"- all right, so you've seen the unboxing.",0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
now it's time for the breakdown.,0.0,Neutral,0
"what is using the apple
vision pro actually like?",0.0,Neutral,0
"this is easily one of apple's
craziest, most radical,",0.4666666666666667,Positive,1
possibly dystopian products of all time.,0.0,Neutral,0
"and i have a lot of thoughts here,",0.0,Neutral,0
"like i've been using it
for about a week now.",0.0,Neutral,0
there are some parts of this thing,0.0,Neutral,0
"that are absolutely incredible,",0.9,Positive,1
"and some other parts that feel weird,",-0.3125,Negative,0
or borderline unfinished.,0.0,Neutral,0
"there are all kinds of new technologies,",0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
"from a new operating system
to infrared eye tracking",0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
"to virtually reconstructed
versions of you.",0.0,Neutral,0
"i feel like there are so
many actually new things",0.3181818181818182,Positive,1
"that you have to understand
in order to get a sense",0.0,Neutral,0
"of what this headset
actually is and what it does.",0.0,Neutral,0
"so i'm gonna break this
down into two parts.",-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
"this video is all about
using the vision pro.",0.0,Neutral,0
"it's everything i've
learned from the past week",-0.25,Negative,0
"of wearing and getting used to
this thing every single day.",-0.07142857142857142,Negative,0
"but i'm also working
on a more wide ranging,",0.2,Positive,1
"possibly more existential, review video.",0.5,Positive,1
but let's just start with the more,0.5,Positive,1
"hardware fundamentals, right?",0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
"like what is this thing
that i'm holding literally?",0.0,Neutral,0
"apple vision pro at its core,",0.0,Neutral,0
"well, it is a vr headset.",0.0,Neutral,0
"now, apple would never say that,",0.0,Neutral,0
"and they probably won't like
that i'm saying that word.",0.0,Neutral,0
"you know, i made an entire video",0.0,Neutral,0
"about why they refuse to use those words,",0.0,Neutral,0
"and they're calling it
spatial computing instead.",0.0,Neutral,0
we'll get there.,0.0,Neutral,0
"but the truth is it's a
really, really, really high end",0.16,Positive,1
virtual reality headset.,0.0,Neutral,0
"it's something we've seen before, right?",0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
it's got displays and lenses and speakers,0.0,Neutral,0
and fans and buttons.,0.0,Neutral,0
and this is a form factor.,0.0,Neutral,0
"this is a thing that we have seen before,",0.0,Neutral,0
"but before i even turn this thing on,",0.0,Neutral,0
there are clearly several things,0.0,Neutral,0
"that are a little
different about this one.",-0.09375,Negative,0
"so first of all, it's made of metal.",0.25,Positive,1
"lots of metal and glass
here, which are high quality,",0.16,Positive,1
"but heavy materials, relatively speaking.",-0.1,Negative,0
"so there's this precisely
machined aluminum frame",0.4,Positive,1
around the outside.,0.0,Neutral,0
"and yes, those are intakes
for fans at the bottom.",0.0,Neutral,0
and then vents for those fans at the top.,0.5,Positive,1
"on the right side,
there's your digital crown",0.14285714285714285,Positive,1
that can be pressed in or turned.,0.0,Neutral,0
"and then on the other side is
just a single larger button.",-0.06547619047619048,Negative,0
"so kind of basically the same
two buttons as an apple watch.",0.3,Positive,1
"and then when you get
a little further back",-0.0625,Negative,0
"on this band here, these little pods",-0.1875,Negative,0
"with downward facing
grills, these are speakers",0.0,Neutral,0
"which are pointed straight at your ears,",0.2,Positive,1
and work surprisingly well.,0.7,Positive,1
"though of course, it also
means that people around you",0.0,Neutral,0
"can hear a little bit
of what you're hearing.",-0.1875,Negative,0
"there's a little bit of bleed,",-0.1875,Negative,0
"and i have a lot to say
about spatial audio,",0.0,Neutral,0
so stay tuned for that.,0.0,Neutral,0
but the main event is at the front.,0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
"there is an enormous piece of glass,",0.0,Neutral,0
"which, yes, is very easy
to fingerprint and smudge.",0.5633333333333334,Positive,1
"and then behind that thing,
there's this outward-facing",-0.4,Negative,0
"oled display and a bunch of
sensors all the way around,",0.0,Neutral,0
"outside facing sensors that go forward,",0.0,Neutral,0
"sideways, and straight down.",0.022222222222222213,Positive,1
"and there's depth sensors,
infrared illuminators,",0.0,Neutral,0
"lidar scanners, and just
regular old rgb cameras,",0.05,Positive,1
all being processed by an m2 chip,0.0,Neutral,0
and an r1 chip inside this thing.,0.0,Neutral,0
"and then maybe the craziest part,",0.0,Neutral,0
"inside the headset, there
are a bunch more sensors",0.5,Positive,1
"facing your eyes, tracking
your eyes in real time,",0.2,Positive,1
"for all the eye control and
everything that comes with that.",0.0,Neutral,0
"and also then to display a
representation of your eyes",0.0,Neutral,0
on the outside of the headset.,0.0,Neutral,0
"kinda, we'll get there.",0.0,Neutral,0
"but overall, when you put it all together,",0.0,Neutral,0
"you get a very well made, very high end,",0.20400000000000001,Positive,1
"but also pretty heavy
computer to wear on your face.",0.024999999999999994,Positive,1
"so officially, this headset
with this solo knit band",0.0,Neutral,0
"when i weighed it, showed up as 638 grams,",0.0,Neutral,0
"which some of you on twitter
have already pointed out",0.0,Neutral,0
"is actually slightly less than
the plastic meta quest pro.",-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
"but that quest pro also
has a lot of battery",0.0,Neutral,0
"on the back of your head as
a sort of a counterbalance,",0.0,Neutral,0
"so the weight distribution
is very different.",0.0,Neutral,0
"also, the quest pro is not
that comfortable anyway.",0.4,Positive,1
"but the point is this,
for apple, made the choice",0.0,Neutral,0
"of taking the battery off of
the headset, which means okay,",0.5,Positive,1
"now there's nothing on
the back of your head,",0.0,Neutral,0
"so you can wear it and
lean up against things,",0.0,Neutral,0
"and that might be an upside,",0.0,Neutral,0
but that also now means you have to deal,0.0,Neutral,0
"with this cable all the time
running up to your head,",0.0,Neutral,0
"and the fact that it's
very front weighted now.",0.2,Positive,1
"all of the weight is on
the front of your face.",0.0,Neutral,0
"so this is the battery, as
you saw in the unboxing.",0.0,Neutral,0
"if you haven't already seen the
unboxing, that just went up.",0.0,Neutral,0
i'll link it below the like button.,0.0,Neutral,0
but this battery is a surprisingly small,-0.25,Negative,0
"3,366 milliamp hours.",0.0,Neutral,0
"i say surprisingly small
because a normal battery bank",-0.05,Negative,0
"of this size, you might
expect to be 10, 15,",0.0,Neutral,0
"20,000 milliamp hours.",0.0,Neutral,0
"i suspect there's a lot of
heat insulation happening here.",0.0,Neutral,0
"but it comes with a
non-removable four foot cable,",0.0,Neutral,0
"and a proprietary connector
at the end of the cable",0.0,Neutral,0
that will twist and lock to the headset.,0.0,Neutral,0
and so the lock is really solid.,0.0,Neutral,0
"it makes sense that it's
not just straight usb",0.2,Positive,1
that could get disconnected easily.,0.43333333333333335,Positive,1
"once you connect it, it starts glowing,",0.0,Neutral,0
and then it starts booting up.,0.0,Neutral,0
"and there's even a little
apple logo that displays",-0.1875,Negative,0
"on the outside screen
while it takes, you know,",0.0,Neutral,0
a little under a minute to turn on.,-0.1875,Negative,0
so there is no on or off button,0.0,Neutral,0
or switch anywhere on this headset.,0.0,Neutral,0
"maybe kind of like airpods
max or something like that.",0.6,Positive,1
so if you ever take the headset off,0.0,Neutral,0
"and put it down, it will
enter a standby mode",-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
"after some time, but it won't turn off.",0.0,Neutral,0
"if you wanna turn it off,
you literally have to twist",0.0,Neutral,0
and unplug the cable.,0.0,Neutral,0
"that's the only way to
actually turn the headset off.",0.0,Neutral,0
"now famously already, the battery life",0.5,Positive,1
"with this included
battery, is not super long",-0.10833333333333334,Negative,0
on this headset.,0.0,Neutral,0
two to four hours is actually realistic,0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
"for what you can expect for
just like this built-in battery.",0.0,Neutral,0
but that's also kind of right in line,0.44285714285714284,Positive,1
with a lot of other vr headsets.,-0.125,Negative,0
"battery life on vr headsets
is not that great in general.",0.42500000000000004,Positive,1
"if you do wanna use it longer,
the only way to do that",0.0,Neutral,0
"is there's usbc port on the battery,",0.0,Neutral,0
and you have to plug the battery in.,0.0,Neutral,0
"so you could plug the
battery into the wall",0.0,Neutral,0
"for infinite battery life,",0.0,Neutral,0
"or i guess you could plug it into like a,",0.0,Neutral,0
"you could daisy chain another
battery into the other pocket",-0.125,Negative,0
or something for even longer life.,0.0,Neutral,0
"but yeah, two to four hours.",0.0,Neutral,0
now at first it seemed weird to me,-0.125,Negative,0
"that the port is on the
same side of the battery",0.0,Neutral,0
"as the non-removable cable,",0.0,Neutral,0
"but i think it's because
they just want you to default",0.0,Neutral,0
"to putting this battery in your pocket,",0.0,Neutral,0
probably in your back pocket.,0.0,Neutral,0
"so even if it's plugged into the wall,",0.0,Neutral,0
it can still be in your back pocket.,0.0,Neutral,0
"you're just gonna want to
get a longer usbc cable.",0.0,Neutral,0
"so there are no controllers
that come with this headset.",0.0,Neutral,0
now it does support other input methods,-0.125,Negative,0
"that are like game controllers,
and mouse, and keyboard,",-0.4,Negative,0
"and those can be incredibly useful,",0.3,Positive,1
but by default the primary input method,0.4,Positive,1
for everyone using the vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
is your eyes and your hands.,0.0,Neutral,0
"so the first time you put on this headset,",0.25,Positive,1
"it goes through this calibration process,",0.0,Neutral,0
and it's pretty interesting.,0.375,Positive,1
"so the first time you ever put it on,",0.25,Positive,1
"it first adjusts the
distance between the lenses,",0.25,Positive,1
physically moving them inside the headset,0.0,Neutral,0
to match the distance between your eyes.,0.0,Neutral,0
then it does this sort of a hand scan,0.0,Neutral,0
so it understands your hands.,0.0,Neutral,0
and then you go through this process,0.0,Neutral,0
of basically looking at a bunch of dots,0.0,Neutral,0
"all the way around the screen,",0.0,Neutral,0
"and then tapping your fingers
together to select them.",0.0,Neutral,0
"kind of feels like an
eye test or something.",0.6,Positive,1
and then you're in.,0.0,Neutral,0
so first thing you're gonna notice,0.25,Positive,1
"is you can actually kind
of put your hands anywhere",0.6,Positive,1
"as long as the headset can see this,",-0.05,Negative,0
just your fingers touching together.,0.5,Positive,1
"so there's a lot of pictures
of people using a headset",0.0,Neutral,0
"with their fingers, like
out in front of them,",0.0,Neutral,0
pinching like that.,0.0,Neutral,0
but you actually don't have to do that.,0.0,Neutral,0
"it's such a wide angle
because of the sensors",-0.05,Negative,0
facing forward and sideways and down.,-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
"you can kind of just
rest your hand anywhere,",0.6,Positive,1
"in front of you, in your lap.",0.0,Neutral,0
"as long as you pinch like that,",-0.05,Negative,0
"it can generally pick it
up, which is impressive.",0.525,Positive,1
so you're pinching to control anywhere,0.0,Neutral,0
in that 180 degree bubble in front of you.,0.0,Neutral,0
"and then the digital
crown, you hit that once,",0.0,Neutral,0
"and the app drawer
comes up, pretty simple.",0.125,Positive,1
doesn't seem that impressive.,1.0,Positive,1
"but this is actually a peek
at the first really impressive",0.4166666666666667,Positive,1
"thing about this headset to
me, which is it seems to have",0.0,Neutral,0
"incredible spatial positioning lock,",0.9,Positive,1
"and like, it's really hard
to have you appreciate this",-0.2916666666666667,Negative,0
through a youtube video.,0.0,Neutral,0
reviewing vr headsets is hard.,-0.2916666666666667,Negative,0
"but turn around in the room you're in,",0.0,Neutral,0
and picture a wall or a window,0.0,Neutral,0
"just appearing locked in place
in 3d space in your room,",0.0,Neutral,0
"and no matter how much you move your head,",0.2,Positive,1
"or move around, it stays
exactly kind of floating",0.6,Positive,1
where it's supposed to be.,0.0,Neutral,0
"but when i say floating, i
think you're picturing like a,",0.0,Neutral,0
"a soft float, but it's locked,
and that's how it starts.",0.1,Positive,1
so now you're in apple's new vision os,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
"i would describe this as
kind of similar to ipad os,",0.3,Positive,1
"but way more glassy, and of course",0.5,Positive,1
with the extra dimension of 3d space.,0.0,Neutral,0
"so hitting a digital crown
will always get the app drawer",0.0,Neutral,0
"back in front of you, and
then simply look at the icon",0.0,Neutral,0
"you want and pinch your fingers together,",0.0,Neutral,0
to select it and open that app.,0.0,Neutral,0
"scrolling is basically as you'd expect,",0.0,Neutral,0
"you just kind of pinch
and grab in the air,",0.6,Positive,1
"and then pull as if it's on a string,",0.0,Neutral,0
"and physics let you pull
things through the air.",0.0,Neutral,0
"it's pretty intuitive, it's
responsive, it's fluid.",0.125,Positive,1
sometimes it's kind of bouncy even.,0.6,Positive,1
i would say the biggest adjustment,0.0,Neutral,0
is only being able to control,0.25,Positive,1
exactly what you're looking at.,0.25,Positive,1
and i don't think people realize,0.0,Neutral,0
how often they're controlling things,0.0,Neutral,0
"that they're not exactly
looking directly at",-0.012499999999999997,Negative,0
with other computers and other uis.,-0.125,Negative,0
"but with this, you can look
at the button to select it,",0.0,Neutral,0
"and if you look at the
next thing you're gonna do,",0.0,Neutral,0
you're no longer controlling the button.,0.0,Neutral,0
"you have to look exactly
where you're trying",0.25,Positive,1
to interact with things.,0.0,Neutral,0
it takes a few extra brain cycles,-0.1,Negative,0
to remember to always be looking,0.0,Neutral,0
exactly at the thing you're controlling.,0.25,Positive,1
"so when you open a window
of a vision os app,",0.0,Neutral,0
"like any one of the
default apple apps here,",0.0,Neutral,0
"it locks into place, it's floating there.",0.0,Neutral,0
"it kind of looks, again, like an ipad app,",0.6,Positive,1
"but very glassy, like this
frosted glass around the ui",0.2,Positive,1
sort of lets you see through a little bit,-0.1875,Negative,0
to the color behind it.,-0.4,Negative,0
"and it even sometimes casts
a shadow on the ground",0.0,Neutral,0
"in the correct z space,
so it really solidifies",0.2,Positive,1
that it's floating in front of you.,0.0,Neutral,0
all this makes it feel like the window,0.0,Neutral,0
is in the space around you.,0.0,Neutral,0
"then if you look at the
bottom of the window,",0.0,Neutral,0
"you get a little bar, you can
always just look at that bar",-0.1875,Negative,0
and pinch to drag it around.,-0.1,Negative,0
"so drag it forward,
backward, anywhere you want",-0.1,Negative,0
"in x, y, and z space, and then let go",0.0,Neutral,0
and it just stays absolutely locked.,0.2,Positive,1
"and then you can look at
either bottom corner to resize",0.0,Neutral,0
to make it bigger or smaller.,0.0,Neutral,0
"and then finally there's
a little x at the bottom,",-0.09375,Negative,0
"you select that, that closes it.",0.0,Neutral,0
"so that is the basics of vision os,",0.0,Neutral,0
and just using an app.,0.0,Neutral,0
"now this entire time, by default,",0.0,Neutral,0
"and almost any time they
can, passthrough is on,",0.0,Neutral,0
"which means you have the headset on,",0.0,Neutral,0
but you can see with the cameras,0.0,Neutral,0
right through to everything around you.,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
"and i think this is
where apple really wants",0.2,Positive,1
"to normalize the term spatial computing,",0.0,Neutral,0
because it feels like augmented reality.,0.0,Neutral,0
"it feels like you're always
able to see the space",0.5,Positive,1
"around you, but technically
it's not actually ar,",0.0,Neutral,0
"because you are still looking
at a reconstructed version",0.0,Neutral,0
"through a camera feed
of the world around you",0.0,Neutral,0
instead of the actual world around you.,0.0,Neutral,0
but maybe it's all just semantics.,0.0,Neutral,0
"i will say, this is the best
passthrough of any vr headset",1.0,Positive,1
"i've ever used, and it's
not even that close.",0.0,Neutral,0
"now again, it's so hard to get
this through a youtube video.",-0.2916666666666667,Negative,0
"it does have screen recording built in,",0.0,Neutral,0
so i'm gonna try to use that.,0.0,Neutral,0
"but imagine putting a headset on,",0.0,Neutral,0
"and not really feeling like
you're looking at a screen",-0.1,Negative,0
with the real world.,0.2,Positive,1
"because of the pixel density,",0.0,Neutral,0
"because of the 90 hertz refresh rate,",0.0,Neutral,0
"and because of the impressive
dynamic range of the cameras",0.5,Positive,1
"and the correctly adjusting shutter speed,",0.0,Neutral,0
"you just almost don't,",0.0,Neutral,0
you almost just feel like you're looking,0.0,Neutral,0
"at the real world, not through a headset.",0.2,Positive,1
"also the passthrough is
so close to real time",0.2,Positive,1
"that i could legitimately
interact with all kinds of things.",0.0,Neutral,0
i could catch items flying at me.,0.0,Neutral,0
i even tried playing ping pong.,0.0,Neutral,0
"it was easy, no hesitation.",0.43333333333333335,Positive,1
"so officially, the r1 chip
is doing all the processing",0.0,Neutral,0
"of all this stuff and
adjusting the shutter speed",0.0,Neutral,0
for different lighting conditions,0.0,Neutral,0
and always keeping passthrough latency,0.0,Neutral,0
"under 12 milliseconds, which
is the lowest in the industry.",0.0,Neutral,0
"but it's really combining
that with how close to reality",0.2,Positive,1
"the colors and brightness
and everything are",0.0,Neutral,0
that keeps it feeling kind of real.,0.4,Positive,1
"basically, the only noticeable restriction",0.0,Neutral,0
"is super close up items and
objects can get a bit blurry,",0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
"and then you can't quite
make out really small",-0.25,Negative,0
"or fine texts, so you can't read an email",0.4166666666666667,Positive,1
"or a tiny text on your phone in your hand,",0.0,Neutral,0
"but you can absolutely text people,",0.2,Positive,1
"or read your notifications,
while keeping the headset on.",0.0,Neutral,0
"if you've tried other vr headsets,",-0.125,Negative,0
you know how impressive that is.,1.0,Positive,1
"it's just, it's really good with the tech",0.7,Positive,1
that exists now for vr headsets.,0.0,Neutral,0
"but you can definitely
still take the headset off",0.0,Neutral,0
"and be like, oh, it's way brighter in here",0.0,Neutral,0
than i thought it was.,0.0,Neutral,0
"either way, that's all passthrough,",0.0,Neutral,0
"but if you ever wanna
fully immerse yourself,",0.0,Neutral,0
"i mean it is a vr headset after all,",-0.3125,Negative,0
"all you gotta do is rotate
this digital crown clockwise,",0.0,Neutral,0
"just keep turning it, and it will slowly",-0.30000000000000004,Negative,0
"dial your environment more and
more into your field of view",0.5,Positive,1
"until you dial it all the way
up to fully surrounding you.",0.0,Neutral,0
"so all of the windows
you might have had open",0.0,Neutral,0
"will still stay stuck where they were,",0.0,Neutral,0
"but everything you're doing
is just on the moon now.",0.0,Neutral,0
"so yeah, there's a couple environments",0.0,Neutral,0
"apple has built in here,",0.0,Neutral,0
"most of them relaxing scenic locations,",0.5,Positive,1
"like in california somewhere,",0.0,Neutral,0
or one really nice one is mount hood,0.6,Positive,1
with a little bit of rain falling.,-0.1875,Negative,0
"they're not quite photorealistic,",0.0,Neutral,0
"but they're just short of photorealistic,",0.0,Neutral,0
"like they're the most
realistic digital environments",0.2222222222222222,Positive,1
that i've seen.,0.0,Neutral,0
"so then the last two big quirks
of the ui, control center.",-0.03333333333333333,Negative,0
so the only way to get to control center,-0.05,Negative,0
"is to look up, and you can't just look up,",0.0,Neutral,0
"but you have to physically
turn your head up",0.0,Neutral,0
"and look at this arrow
that appears above you.",0.0,Neutral,0
"so once you see that, you select that",0.0,Neutral,0
"and then you get your control
center for things like,",-0.1,Negative,0
"you know, battery life and
notifications, focus modes,",0.0,Neutral,0
"and screen recording,
and pairing to a mac.",0.0,Neutral,0
but the other big quirk is text input.,-0.0625,Negative,0
"so you might be wondering
how does text input work",0.0,Neutral,0
with no physical controllers?,0.0,Neutral,0
"so there's basically
three ways to do this.",0.0,Neutral,0
"so let's say you are in safari,",0.0,Neutral,0
and you want to go to mkbhd.com.,0.0,Neutral,0
"you really want one of those
shiny new chevron hoodies",0.16818181818181818,Positive,1
for the rest of winter.,0.0,Neutral,0
"great, how do you do it?",0.8,Positive,1
"so the first way is to
literally hunt and peck",0.25,Positive,1
poking the keys on the keyboard,0.0,Neutral,0
that appears in the air in front of you.,0.0,Neutral,0
"so this one is tough, because
it literally only reacts",-0.19444444444444445,Negative,0
to your pointer finger on each hand.,0.0,Neutral,0
"so you actually can't type fast,",0.1,Positive,1
like with home row or anything like that.,0.0,Neutral,0
not great.,-0.4,Negative,0
"the second way, though, i
think is actually kind of good.",0.4333333333333333,Positive,1
"it's at least faster,
which is looking at the key",-0.15,Negative,0
"you want to interact with, and
then pinching to select it.",0.0,Neutral,0
"so just looking around
the keyboard like this,",0.0,Neutral,0
and selecting the keys.,0.0,Neutral,0
"and you might be surprised how
fast you can type like this",0.15000000000000002,Positive,1
"if you actually know your way
around a keyboard pretty well.",0.125,Positive,1
"i actually prefer this to
poking the virtual keys",0.0,Neutral,0
"because i at least get a
little bit of haptic feedback",-0.24375,Negative,0
from my own fingers tapping together.,0.6,Positive,1
"but then in safari, the last way to do it",0.0,Neutral,0
"is literally to just
look up at the microphone",0.0,Neutral,0
and say the url out loud.,0.1,Positive,1
mkbhd.com.,0.0,Neutral,0
and then it just hears you,0.0,Neutral,0
"and goes to the site pretty quick,",0.29166666666666663,Positive,1
"if it's a url that you
can actually say out loud.",0.05,Positive,1
"so, what can you actually
do with this thing?",0.0,Neutral,0
"like now that we know what
it is, it's the m2 chip,",0.0,Neutral,0
a computer on your face with the displays,0.0,Neutral,0
"and the lenses inside, and all
sorts of sensors everywhere.",0.0,Neutral,0
what can this thing actually do?,0.0,Neutral,0
"and i feel like the most
common way to phrase that",0.1,Positive,1
is what is the killer app?,0.0,Neutral,0
"because that's, we feel
like we need some sort",0.0,Neutral,0
"of justification to spend
three, 4,000 on this thing.",0.0,Neutral,0
"like applications made the
iphone what it is as we know it,",0.0,Neutral,0
like apps made the ipad.,0.0,Neutral,0
"so what is the app
situation on the vision pro?",0.0,Neutral,0
"so there are two types of apps
on the vision pro, actually.",0.0,Neutral,0
"the first is apps that
are built specifically",0.25,Positive,1
for the vision pro to take advantage,0.0,Neutral,0
of its awesome experiences.,1.0,Positive,1
"and there are a few of those right now,",0.042857142857142844,Positive,1
"and then there are all the other apps,",-0.125,Negative,0
which basically are iphone and ipad apps,0.0,Neutral,0
that happen to be compatible,0.0,Neutral,0
because the developer didn't opt out.,0.0,Neutral,0
and the first kind is way cooler.,0.425,Positive,1
so these are apple's stock apps here,0.0,Neutral,0
that come with the vision pro.,0.0,Neutral,0
"and so these are all, of course,
made just for vision pro.",0.0,Neutral,0
"so they're gonna have stuff
that takes full advantage",0.35,Positive,1
of what this thing is capable of.,0.2,Positive,1
"apple music is a pretty classic one,",0.20833333333333331,Positive,1
like it has all the same functionality,0.0,Neutral,0
"of any other apple music app,",-0.125,Negative,0
"but in this super glassy frosted window,",0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
"and shows the colors of
whatever's behind it.",-0.4,Negative,0
"and you have the sort of sorting
menu on the left hand side",0.0,Neutral,0
instead of across the bottom.,0.0,Neutral,0
that's the basic layout.,0.0,Neutral,0
"same thing with the notes
app and the settings app.",0.0,Neutral,0
"very glassy, almost looking
like an ipad app in the air,",0.2,Positive,1
"just rebuilt with this
new material design.",0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
and then there's the media apps.,0.0,Neutral,0
"so apple tv and disney+,
they both come pre-installed,",0.0,Neutral,0
which they have built entire environments,0.0,Neutral,0
inside of them for watching media.,0.0,Neutral,0
"and there's even a small
collection of videos",-0.25,Negative,0
on the apple tv app that are shot,0.0,Neutral,0
on a new proprietary format,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
specifically for vision pro.,0.0,Neutral,0
"so it drops you into a space
with a full 180 degree video,",0.35,Positive,1
and alicia keys walks right up to you,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
and starts singing right to your face.,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
it's crazy.,-0.6,Negative,0
"there's also the photos app,",0.0,Neutral,0
"which will let you look
at panoramic photos,",0.0,Neutral,0
"for example, in this fully immersive view.",0.0,Neutral,0
"so you can blow them up to full screen,",0.35,Positive,1
"and then it gives you a
bit of a parallax effect",0.0,Neutral,0
"around the edges, so it
feels like you're looking",0.0,Neutral,0
"into a window of your own
photo and looking around.",0.6,Positive,1
it's kind of incredible.,0.75,Positive,1
"and then there's also
some other really fun",0.0875,Positive,1
third party apps that i've tried,0.0,Neutral,0
that were built ahead of time.,0.0,Neutral,0
"so sky guide, this is a good one.",0.7,Positive,1
"you can look around a real
representation of the sky",0.2,Positive,1
"around you or any of the
constellations would normally be,",0.15,Positive,1
"you can look at it a little
longer and it'll pop it out.",-0.1875,Negative,0
you can pull it outta the sky,0.0,Neutral,0
to get more information about it.,0.5,Positive,1
it's a pretty great idea.,0.525,Positive,1
"there's another one called jig space,",0.0,Neutral,0
"which is, it's a sick app,",-0.7142857142857143,Negative,0
"i don't know if i'd ever use it,",0.0,Neutral,0
but basically it lets you load 3d models,0.0,Neutral,0
"into the space you're in
and mess around with them,",-0.175,Negative,0
"take 'em apart, view them in actual size.",0.0,Neutral,0
"and this really takes
advantage of how good",0.44999999999999996,Positive,1
the placement lock is on the vision pro.,0.0,Neutral,0
"and you can walk around,
and really gets you",0.2,Positive,1
"a better understanding
of the scale of things",0.5,Positive,1
"that you don't get to
see up close very often.",0.2,Positive,1
and then keynote is another funny one.,0.25,Positive,1
"so you can of course go
through and edit a keynote",0.0,Neutral,0
"just like normal if you want to,",0.15,Positive,1
"but then they've built
this whole environment",0.2,Positive,1
for practicing your presentation skills.,0.0,Neutral,0
"so you press that and it
says, oh, would you like to go",0.0,Neutral,0
"to a conference room, or the
literal steve jobs theater,",0.0,Neutral,0
"so you can rehearse
talking to your audience",0.0,Neutral,0
with your keynote slides behind you.,-0.4,Negative,0
it is genuinely incredibly immersive.,0.9,Positive,1
"and there's already a
bunch more apps like this",0.5,Positive,1
in the app store already at launch,0.0,Neutral,0
"that are specifically
built for vision pro.",0.0,Neutral,0
"so they'll take advantage
of its various strengths.",0.0,Neutral,0
"now, are any of these a killer app?",0.0,Neutral,0
not really.,-0.1,Negative,0
"i mean i don't, if you're
looking for any one of these",-0.3125,Negative,0
"to be the reason why you spend
like 4,000 on this headset,",0.0,Neutral,0
i don't think we have that yet.,0.0,Neutral,0
"but then at least there's
all the other non-native,",-0.2125,Negative,0
"but technically still compatible, apps",0.0,Neutral,0
that are in the app store.,0.0,Neutral,0
"and these are gonna look just
like iphone and ipad apps.",0.0,Neutral,0
"actually, there's a pre-installed
folder on the home screen",0.0,Neutral,0
"when you get this thing
literally called compatible apps,",0.0,Neutral,0
"and there's a bunch of
them from apple here.",0.0,Neutral,0
they look exactly like ipad apps.,0.25,Positive,1
"i'm surprised actually
that more of them aren't",0.19999999999999998,Positive,1
"fully built out to take
advantage of vision pro,",0.0,Neutral,0
"but like, apple maps is just the ipad app.",0.0,Neutral,0
"and so it would be cool
if there were some fun",0.32499999999999996,Positive,1
"augmented reality overlay
walking directions type stuff,",0.0,Neutral,0
"but nope, it's all the
exact same functionality",0.125,Positive,1
"that you would find if you
opened this app on your ipad.",0.0,Neutral,0
and you can go to the app store,0.0,Neutral,0
and search a bunch of the names of apps,0.0,Neutral,0
"you already know and love,
and find them by name",0.5,Positive,1
"and grab them, and they'll
work the exact same way.",0.125,Positive,1
"crazily enough though, there are already",0.0,Neutral,0
some notable exceptions.,0.5,Positive,1
"no netflix app for the
vision pro, no youtube app",0.0,Neutral,0
"for the vision pro, no spotify
app for the vision pro.",0.0,Neutral,0
"apple has kind of a
contentious relationship",0.6,Positive,1
"with a lot of developers right now,",0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
especially some of the bigger ones.,0.0,Neutral,0
"and so some have made the
active choice to opt out.",-0.13333333333333333,Negative,0
"they're like, we don't wanna be there.",0.0,Neutral,0
"this won't be a big enough
platform to matter to us",0.0,Neutral,0
to justify the work.,0.0,Neutral,0
so they're not there.,0.0,Neutral,0
"now i totally get it,",0.0,Neutral,0
but also now as a vision pro owner,0.0,Neutral,0
"and someone who's using it,",0.0,Neutral,0
"i'm like, oh, it's kind of a bummer.",0.6,Positive,1
"i really wanted to be able to
watch a netflix show offline,",0.35,Positive,1
"downloaded it ahead of time,
but you can't do that now.",0.0,Neutral,0
"but at least, at least
for now, for the record,",-0.3,Negative,0
"you can use the browser,",0.0,Neutral,0
"and anything that would
work in the browser.",0.0,Neutral,0
"so if you pull up safari,",0.0,Neutral,0
"and you get a full screen
4k youtube video going,",0.35,Positive,1
"and locked in space, or
even in an environment,",0.0,Neutral,0
it looks great.,0.8,Positive,1
it's razor sharp.,-0.125,Negative,0
"like, i could totally watch
youtube videos like this.",0.0,Neutral,0
"but you will definitely
be missing the features",-0.2,Negative,0
"of having the dedicated
app, like offline video.",0.0,Neutral,0
"honestly to me, the killer
app of the vision pro",0.6,Positive,1
"isn't just an app, it's
actually the ecosystem.",0.0,Neutral,0
"and we knew this was coming,",0.0,Neutral,0
"but the second you log into a
vision pro with your apple id,",0.0,Neutral,0
"immediately it starts
pulling all the services,",0.0,Neutral,0
and all the stuff that you're used to,0.0,Neutral,0
"from all the other apple
devices you already have.",-0.125,Negative,0
"and i said this before the
vision pro was announced,",0.0,Neutral,0
"i was like, this is the most
obvious strategy for apple",0.25,Positive,1
because there are lots of people out there,0.0,Neutral,0
"who have never considered
buying a vr headset",0.0,Neutral,0
that are considering only this one,0.0,Neutral,0
"because they have an iphone,",0.0,Neutral,0
"and this is the one that
works with the iphone,",0.0,Neutral,0
"and none of the others
are particularly close.",0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
"so all of your imessages are already here,",0.0,Neutral,0
all of your photos are already here,0.0,Neutral,0
and loaded up and backed up.,0.0,Neutral,0
"all your notes are already
at your fingertips.",0.0,Neutral,0
you already saw the keynote app.,0.0,Neutral,0
"but okay, easily my favorite feature",0.5,Positive,1
"is connecting to your mac, right?",0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
so anytime your mac is in front of you,0.0,Neutral,0
"and it's turned on, hit that arrow",0.0,Neutral,0
and then there's this little icon,-0.1875,Negative,0
to become my mac's virtual display.,0.0,Neutral,0
"so i click that, and then pick my mac,",0.0,Neutral,0
"and it pretty much instantly,
it actually blacks out",0.125,Positive,1
"the display of my mac, and
then turns that display",0.0,Neutral,0
into a 4k window inside of the headset.,0.0,Neutral,0
"so now my keyboard and
trackpad still work,",0.0,Neutral,0
even if it is a desktop.,0.0,Neutral,0
"the keyboard and the trackpad
still control everything,",0.0,Neutral,0
"and you can continue using it
just like a normal computer,",0.15,Positive,1
"but with the ability to
make your new 4k monitor",0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
"as big or as small or close
or far away as you want,",-0.049999999999999996,Negative,0
which is super sick.,-0.1904761904761905,Negative,0
"and then the bonus is
you can still open up",0.0,Neutral,0
"and place other vision pro
apps around your mac computer.",-0.125,Negative,0
"so like you can have your
mac in the middle here,",0.0,Neutral,0
"and maybe you're editing or
doing some work on the mac app,",0.0,Neutral,0
"and then you have a safari
window, or messages,",0.0,Neutral,0
"or whatever else you want
right next to it around it.",0.14285714285714285,Positive,1
"and then your keyboard
and trackpad can move",0.0,Neutral,0
"seamlessly between them
all to control all of them.",0.1,Positive,1
"this, to me, as a mac user,
the ease of use for setup",0.0,Neutral,0
"to make this happen, this feels like",0.0,Neutral,0
"the biggest game changer,",-0.4,Negative,0
"like the most compelling
futuristic feeling",0.4,Positive,1
use of this headset to me.,0.0,Neutral,0
especially on a plane.,0.0,Neutral,0
"oh my god, i can't tell you how many times",0.5,Positive,1
"i've had an awkward conversation because,",-0.6,Negative,0
"like, i'm editing a video on the plane,",0.0,Neutral,0
"the person next to me sees
i'm editing a video of myself,",0.0,Neutral,0
"and it's kind of weird
and hard to explain,",-0.0638888888888889,Negative,0
"but i'm picturing putting the headset on,",0.0,Neutral,0
"the display blacks out,",0.0,Neutral,0
"but now i can do all the editing i want,",0.0,Neutral,0
"and i can make the
screen as big as i want.",0.0,Neutral,0
so i've really enjoyed using that feature.,0.5,Positive,1
"again, the biggest challenge, though,",0.0,Neutral,0
"is still remembering to
look exactly at the thing",0.25,Positive,1
you want to control.,0.0,Neutral,0
so aside from typing on the real keyboard,0.2,Positive,1
"on whatever window is open, if you want",0.0,Neutral,0
"to control something, you
have to be looking at it.",0.0,Neutral,0
"again, it doesn't sound like a big deal,",0.2,Positive,1
"but when you try it,
you'll see what i mean.",-0.3125,Negative,0
"and then also, odd
limitation, one monitor only.",-0.08333333333333333,Negative,0
"from the mac, one virtual
monitor only at a time.",0.0,Neutral,0
"so if you usually run a
dual display setup like i do",-0.25,Negative,0
"for final cut pro, big
preview on one side,",0.0,Neutral,0
"timeline on the other
side, you can't do that.",-0.125,Negative,0
"you have to use the big one
monitor version of your setup.",0.0,Neutral,0
"all right, so you might have realized",0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
i've left one thing out this whole time.,0.1,Positive,1
"one thing, you could call
it one more thing, sure.",0.5,Positive,1
"it's one more huge crazy thing,",0.10000000000000005,Positive,1
"but it's kind of the defining
characteristic of this product",0.26666666666666666,Positive,1
and that is personas.,0.0,Neutral,0
"so in all the advertising
you've seen of vision pro,",0.0,Neutral,0
"there's these eyes on the
outside of the headset",0.0,Neutral,0
"that looks like they're
kind of in a passthrough,",0.6,Positive,1
"like in a dark astronaut
helmet type of thing.",-0.15,Negative,0
"easily the most memed, most unique aspect",0.45208333333333334,Positive,1
"of this headset, right?",0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
"it's the only headset
with an outward display.",0.0,Neutral,0
"and i mean it's very, very
prominent in those videos,",0.16875,Positive,1
"but in real life, as you've started to see",0.2,Positive,1
"from some of my footage,
it is very different,",0.0,Neutral,0
and i think i figured out why.,0.0,Neutral,0
"so first of all, it's not
actually see-through, right?",0.17857142857142858,Positive,1
there's a whole bunch of computer,0.2,Positive,1
in between me and you right now.,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
so the eyes aren't on the outside.,0.0,Neutral,0
it's a representation of my eyes,0.0,Neutral,0
"based on what all the sensors
on the inside are seeing.",0.0,Neutral,0
it's reconstructing it on the outside.,0.0,Neutral,0
"so those sensors are tracking
at 90 frames per second,",0.0,Neutral,0
"and they give you optic id, which is,",0.0,Neutral,0
"it's how you log into the
headset and keep things secure.",0.4,Positive,1
"it's basically the same
as face id, or touch id,",0.0,Neutral,0
"it's just looking at and
identifying your eyes.",0.0,Neutral,0
"and it also powers the one
beta feature of this headset,",0.0,Neutral,0
"which is personas, which
is, it's the most impressive",0.75,Positive,1
"and weirdest thing about this
headset at the same time.",0.0,Neutral,0
i'm calling it right now.,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
so the purpose of the eyes on the outside,0.0,Neutral,0
"is really not for you,
the wearer of the headset.",-0.1,Negative,0
"in fact, you'll never see it.",0.0,Neutral,0
but it's for the people around you.,0.0,Neutral,0
"so when you're in a passthrough mode,",0.0,Neutral,0
your eyes will shine through,0.0,Neutral,0
to indicate that you wearing the headset,0.0,Neutral,0
can see the person outside.,0.0,Neutral,0
"so that right there is
already pretty unique.",0.30357142857142855,Positive,1
"but then, when you're
in something immersive",0.0,Neutral,0
"and you can't see what's around
you, it covers up your eyes",0.0,Neutral,0
"with this sort of like a blue,
purple glowing animation.",0.0,Neutral,0
so that intuitively makes sense.,0.0,Neutral,0
"you can see the eyes
when they can see you,",0.0,Neutral,0
"you can't see the eyes
when they can't see you.",0.0,Neutral,0
"but crazily enough, there's also a feature",0.0,Neutral,0
"where if you have someone
who's outside the headset",0.0,Neutral,0
"looking at you, talking to you,",0.0,Neutral,0
"and you are in an immersion,",0.0,Neutral,0
"but you want to talk to them through that,",0.0,Neutral,0
they will kind of appear through the fog,0.6,Positive,1
"of whatever immersive
environment you're in.",0.0,Neutral,0
"so you just start talking and
looking in their direction.",0.0,Neutral,0
"it detects that, and sort of
parts a little bit of a fog",-0.1875,Negative,0
"and that person's eyes
will show through the fog.",0.0,Neutral,0
it's pretty decent.,0.20833333333333331,Positive,1
"it basically only shows
one person at a time.",0.0,Neutral,0
"and when this is happening on
the outside of the headset,",0.0,Neutral,0
"it shows a little bit of
your eyes poking through",-0.1875,Negative,0
the purple and blue glow.,0.0,Neutral,0
"it's, as you can see, it's all working,",0.0,Neutral,0
"but also, i think it looks
nothing like the eyes",0.0,Neutral,0
from the ad.,0.0,Neutral,0
so in an effort to make the eyes,0.0,Neutral,0
"as presentable as possible, two things.",0.0,Neutral,0
"first of all, this
screen is actually behind",-0.07500000000000001,Negative,0
"a lenticular film, which
i didn't even realize that",0.0,Neutral,0
from the initial media they had published.,0.0,Neutral,0
"but if you've ever heard of that,",0.0,Neutral,0
it's sort of what gives it this 3d depth.,0.0,Neutral,0
"you might have seen this on
other holographic displays",-0.125,Negative,0
"and stuff, but the point of that",0.0,Neutral,0
"is to make the eyes appear to
be sunken into the display,",0.0,Neutral,0
"like on your actual face,",0.0,Neutral,0
"instead of glued to the
front of the headset,",0.0,Neutral,0
which would look a little more weird.,-0.0625,Negative,0
"but then two, to represent
your actual eyes,",0.0,Neutral,0
they've built in a way to scan in,0.0,Neutral,0
"and create a digital
representation of your face,",0.0,Neutral,0
which is called your persona.,0.0,Neutral,0
and it looks like this.,0.0,Neutral,0
so to get those eyes on the outside,0.0,Neutral,0
"of the vision pro headset,
you have to do something",0.0,Neutral,0
called registering your persona.,0.0,Neutral,0
"this is how it creates
the digital version of you",0.0,Neutral,0
"that includes your eyes
that will show up here.",0.0,Neutral,0
so let's do that now.,0.0,Neutral,0
it's actually kind of a cool process.,0.475,Positive,1
"so i'm gonna put it on, and
hopefully the screen recording",0.0,Neutral,0
"works so you can see
exactly what i'm doing.",0.25,Positive,1
i'll hit the digital crown.,0.0,Neutral,0
i'm gonna go to settings.,0.0,Neutral,0
"and you can do this when
you first set it up.",0.25,Positive,1
"but i'm going to persona, and
i'm gonna hit get started.",0.0,Neutral,0
so let's refine my hands real quick.,0.5,Positive,1
"this is capturing detail
from the front of the headset",0.0,Neutral,0
of the hands in front of me.,0.0,Neutral,0
once it's done with that-,0.0,Neutral,0
"- automated voice your
persona, remove apple vision pro.",0.0,Neutral,0
- it's gonna ask me to take it off.,0.0,Neutral,0
so this is how it goes.,0.0,Neutral,0
"- automated voice when you're ready,",0.2,Positive,1
hold apple vision pro at eye level.,0.0,Neutral,0
keep your arms and shoulders relaxed.,0.0,Neutral,0
align your entire face within the frame.,0.0,Neutral,0
- marques my face shows up like face id.,0.0,Neutral,0
"- automated voice slowly
turn your head to the right.",-0.007142857142857173,Negative,0
now slowly turn your head to the left.,-0.15000000000000002,Negative,0
"now tilt your head up,",0.0,Neutral,0
then tilt your head down.,-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
"next, let's capture
your facial expressions.",0.0,Neutral,0
smile with your mouth closed.,0.09999999999999999,Positive,1
"then make a big smile
with your teeth showing.",0.15,Positive,1
now raise your eyebrows.,0.0,Neutral,0
close your eyes for a moment.,0.0,Neutral,0
capture complete.,0.1,Positive,1
put vision pro back on to continue.,0.0,Neutral,0
- i will do that.,0.0,Neutral,0
"so now i have a menu that
says creating persona,",0.0,Neutral,0
"and it says it's in beta,",0.0,Neutral,0
and now there's my persona right there.,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
kind of uncanny.,0.6,Positive,1
"the hair's a little bit
different, but the face.",-0.09375,Negative,0
"wow, wow.",0.1,Positive,1
okay.,0.5,Positive,1
so there's different lighting.,0.0,Neutral,0
"you can choose it to always
be in studio lighting,",0.0,Neutral,0
and always be in contour lighting.,0.0,Neutral,0
"i'll just leave it at
natural, and hit next.",0.05,Positive,1
"you can change the color
temperature of your skin tone.",0.0,Neutral,0
"cool to warm, i think i'm around there.",0.475,Positive,1
"brightness, darkness.",0.0,Neutral,0
"i think i'm around there, near the middle.",0.05,Positive,1
next.,0.0,Neutral,0
and then i can add glasses.,0.0,Neutral,0
"so if i typically have glasses,",-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
which obviously i wouldn't be able to wear,0.25,Positive,1
"in the vision pro, you can still
look like you have glasses,",0.0,Neutral,0
anytime you're on that facetime call.,0.0,Neutral,0
and then next.,0.0,Neutral,0
save.,0.0,Neutral,0
and that's it.,0.0,Neutral,0
so i think now,0.0,Neutral,0
you should see my eyes.,0.0,Neutral,0
maybe.,0.0,Neutral,0
"and that that's the
thing, it barely shows up.",0.05,Positive,1
"you can barely see my eyes
when i'm wearing the headset.",0.05,Positive,1
"now i've tried a couple
other scans subsequently,",-0.0625,Negative,0
"so i've tried different
lighting conditions,",0.0,Neutral,0
"i've tried different
backgrounds, simple backgrounds,",0.0,Neutral,0
"tried different shirts
and things like that.",0.0,Neutral,0
"it doesn't really ever
appear any brighter.",0.2,Positive,1
"i think if you have a
darker skin tone like me,",0.0,Neutral,0
"just don't expect the eyes
to show up very brightly",0.9100000000000001,Positive,1
on the outside of the headset.,0.0,Neutral,0
it's pretty subtle.,-0.04166666666666666,Negative,0
"even when it does show up,
it's a little weird looking.",-0.34375,Negative,0
"the eyes are a little
too far apart sometimes.",-0.04375,Negative,0
they're a little dim.,-0.04375,Negative,0
you see one eye at a time.,0.0,Neutral,0
it's kind of weird.,0.04999999999999999,Positive,1
but that persona though.,0.0,Neutral,0
whew.,0.0,Neutral,0
that is some pretty interesting stuff.,0.375,Positive,1
"it's crazy that this is actually
a real thing being shipped,",-0.19999999999999998,Negative,0
like first meta started doing it.,0.25,Positive,1
now apple's doing this.,0.0,Neutral,0
"this is, again, it's technically in beta.",0.0,Neutral,0
"so i dunno, there's room for improvement,",0.0,Neutral,0
but it still works.,0.0,Neutral,0
"but as of right now, i feel like this is",0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
"both incredibly impressive
and slightly unsettling.",0.25,Positive,1
"like, it's very impressive
that this thing,",1.0,Positive,1
"this headset i'm wearing on my face,",0.0,Neutral,0
"is tracking all these
little micro expressions",-0.1875,Negative,0
"and little movements for
my eyes and my cheeks",-0.1875,Negative,0
and my mouth and everything.,0.0,Neutral,0
"but at the same time,
it's just not quite human.",0.0,Neutral,0
"it's right at the edge
of the uncanny valley",0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
of i'm not looking at a person.,0.0,Neutral,0
so yeah.,0.0,Neutral,0
"but the crazy part is you
can now use this persona",-0.6,Negative,0
"as your camera feed for
any apps in vision pro",0.0,Neutral,0
"that require a front facing
camera, like facetime.",0.0,Neutral,0
"and so i've tried, i've
been using facetime",0.0,Neutral,0
"a few times in the vision pro,",-0.2,Negative,0
"and it is, technically
speaking, incredible.",0.45,Positive,1
"so i've made a few facetime
calls in the past few days",-0.21666666666666667,Negative,0
"with some fellow reviewers,",0.0,Neutral,0
"who you'll probably recognize
from their personas,",0.0,Neutral,0
who are also testing the vision pro.,0.0,Neutral,0
"and universally, once we
all got past the shock of,",-0.125,Negative,0
"oh my god, it's you.",0.0,Neutral,0
it looks like a digital version of you.,0.0,Neutral,0
this is crazy.,-0.6,Negative,0
i've never seen anything like this before.,0.0,Neutral,0
"once we got past that, there
is a ton happening here.",-0.25,Negative,0
so you can see the facetime windows,0.0,Neutral,0
literally appear as just that.,0.0,Neutral,0
"they're just like glassy
windows floating in space",0.0,Neutral,0
with people looking through them.,0.0,Neutral,0
"and then the angle that
you look into the window",0.0,Neutral,0
"is gonna match the angle that
they see you looking at them.",0.0,Neutral,0
"meaning if we're all in
vision pros on this call,",0.0,Neutral,0
"unlikely, but hear me out.",-0.5,Negative,0
"if we're all in vision pros,",0.0,Neutral,0
"and you've got a bunch of
people on this facetime call,",0.0,Neutral,0
"so there's somebody to the left,",0.0,Neutral,0
"and somebody to the right,
if i look to the person,",0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
"and make eye contact with
the person to the right,",0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
"the person to the left
sees the side of my head,",0.0,Neutral,0
because i'm looking at somebody else.,0.0,Neutral,0
that's already pretty cool.,0.3,Positive,1
"and then the same thing
is true for hand gestures.",0.175,Positive,1
so we tried this out.,0.0,Neutral,0
turns out you can reach out,0.0,Neutral,0
"and make hand gestures that
are tracked by the cameras",0.0,Neutral,0
"in this bubble in front of you,",0.0,Neutral,0
and they show up at the correct angle,0.0,Neutral,0
"towards the person that
you're gesturing at,",0.0,Neutral,0
so not towards everybody else on the call.,0.0,Neutral,0
"oh wait, wait, wait.",0.0,Neutral,0
"okay, good test.",0.6,Positive,1
"so wait, justine, do you see this?",0.0,Neutral,0
- yes.,0.0,Neutral,0
"- and brian, do you see?
- i don't see that.",0.0,Neutral,0
"i don't see that, marques.
- whoa.",0.0,Neutral,0
- now wait.,0.0,Neutral,0
"so now brian, do you see this?
justine gasps",0.0,Neutral,0
"- now i can see that, marques.",0.0,Neutral,0
"- and then on top of
that, spatial audio here",0.5,Positive,1
is incredibly well developed.,0.5,Positive,1
"so again, you're on the
call, the voice of the person",0.0,Neutral,0
to the right comes from the right side.,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
"the voice of the person to
the left comes from the left.",0.0,Neutral,0
"but also, you can just pick
up and move the window around,",0.0,Neutral,0
"and that angle will match where
the people are in the room",0.0,Neutral,0
"and where their sound
and video comes from.",0.4,Positive,1
"if i put you on the
other side of the room,",-0.125,Negative,0
it sounds like they're further away.,0.0,Neutral,0
"and if i turn up the environment,",0.0,Neutral,0
"and bring them into the
moon, or some other 3d space,",-0.125,Negative,0
"it actually sounds much more
like i'm in a gigantic space",0.25,Positive,1
"with no echo, versus in the actual room.",0.0,Neutral,0
"it's all very subtle,
but very well considered.",-0.11666666666666667,Negative,0
"so once you're in this a while,",0.0,Neutral,0
"you start to notice all
these little smaller things.",-0.09375,Negative,0
"again, it's not quite human-like.",0.0,Neutral,0
"it's not like looking at a
video feed of a human face,",0.0,Neutral,0
"but it is still, like
it has a lot of like,",0.0,Neutral,0
"this would be the best avatar
anyone's ever made in 2k.",1.0,Positive,1
like no one's ever done a 2k face scan,0.0,Neutral,0
"and had it look this good,",0.7,Positive,1
"but it's still not as
good as a perfect reality.",0.85,Positive,1
"it's a, you've heard the
uncanny valley thing before.",0.0,Neutral,0
"i think the number one
weakness for the avatars",0.0,Neutral,0
or the personas that i've seen is hair.,0.0,Neutral,0
so basically everyone i've talked to has,0.0,Neutral,0
like a frozen lump of hair,0.0,Neutral,0
instead of flowing realistic hair.,0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
"and that's true about all flowing things,",0.35,Positive,1
"like however your hair
was when you did the scan,",0.0,Neutral,0
it's frozen that way.,0.0,Neutral,0
"and so is any necklace you're wearing,",0.0,Neutral,0
"whether it's crooked or not,",0.0,Neutral,0
"or i guess, technically
also any makeup you had on,",0.0,Neutral,0
"or however you looked
when you did the scan.",0.0,Neutral,0
maybe that could be a good thing.,0.7,Positive,1
"maybe you did a scan when you
were looking all dolled up,",0.0,Neutral,0
"and then you get on a 7:00 am call,",0.0,Neutral,0
and you still look perfect even though,1.0,Positive,1
"you look like you just
woke up in real life.",0.2,Positive,1
so i guess there's that too.,0.0,Neutral,0
"but anyway, all that is to say facetime.",0.0,Neutral,0
"facetime is the most well thought out,",0.5,Positive,1
"like most futuristic
vision pro experience.",0.5,Positive,1
it just is.,0.0,Neutral,0
so i'll end this video with this.,0.0,Neutral,0
"now you know what it's
like to use and operate",0.0,Neutral,0
the vision pro.,0.0,Neutral,0
but there's still a lot more to consider,0.5,Positive,1
"when actually considering
if you should buy",0.0,Neutral,0
"and own this thing, from the use cases,",0.6,Positive,1
"to the things that work
well, and don't work well,",0.0,Neutral,0
"the philosophy behind it, the
prices, all of that stuff.",-0.4,Negative,0
that's what's gonna be for my full review.,0.35,Positive,1
like there are parts of this thing,0.0,Neutral,0
"that are absolutely amazing,",0.6000000000000001,Positive,1
"unparalleled, best i've ever seen.",1.0,Positive,1
but the reason it's so interesting,0.5,Positive,1
is because it's actually a young category.,0.1,Positive,1
"like we're so used to this
slow, boring iteration",-0.65,Negative,0
"in mature categories, like
smartphones, and laptops,",0.1,Positive,1
and you always see the comments,0.0,Neutral,0
"talking about how tech is so boring,",-1.0,Negative,0
"but now they're actually
jumping into something risky,",0.0,Neutral,0
"and it's actually fun, and
there is downfalls and flaws,",0.3,Positive,1
"and it's fun to actually
weigh the pros and cons.",0.15,Positive,1
so i'll be expanding on all these way more,0.5,Positive,1
"in the full review, but
i'll leave you with this.",0.35,Positive,1
"i've got my upsides and
downsides to vision pro.",0.0,Neutral,0
it's been a week.,0.0,Neutral,0
"upsides, some of the stuff
that's the best i've ever seen",1.0,Positive,1
in a headset.,0.0,Neutral,0
"immersion, placement
in space, eye tracking",0.0,Neutral,0
"and hand control, passthrough, ecosystem,",0.0,Neutral,0
and spatial audio.,0.0,Neutral,0
"and the downsides, weight and comfort,",0.0,Neutral,0
"the eyes on the outside,",0.0,Neutral,0
"app selection right now,
battery life, and price.",0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
so the full reviews in the works.,0.35,Positive,1
"definitely get subscribed
to be among the first",0.125,Positive,1
to see that when it drops.,0.0,Neutral,0
"either way, till the next one.",0.0,Neutral,0
thanks for watching.,0.2,Positive,1
catch you later.,0.0,Neutral,0
peace.,0.0,Neutral,0
- i actually love this thing.,0.5,Positive,1
"i love this thing, not because
it's flawless or anything,",0.75,Positive,1
"it is far from flawless,",0.55,Positive,1
but because it's actually interesting.,0.5,Positive,1
"like, don't forget the
last two, three years",0.0,Neutral,0
"of apple product review comments are just,",0.0,Neutral,0
"""that's boring, oh, it's just a spec bump,",-1.0,Negative,0
"there's nothing really new here,",0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
"oh, they hardly change anything",-0.2916666666666667,Negative,0
"or try anything new these days.""",0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
"but this, this thing is interesting.",0.5,Positive,1
"it's risky, and most of all, it's new.",0.3181818181818182,Positive,1
"now, it's actually not fundamentally new,",0.06818181818181818,Positive,1
"it's a vr headset, but it's new for apple.",0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
and there are a bunch of things in here,0.0,Neutral,0
"that are new in a way
that only apple would try.",0.06818181818181818,Positive,1
"and just as interesting
as this individual product",0.25,Positive,1
is the possible future that this implies.,0.0,Neutral,0
"like, when you get a first
generation product like this,",0.25,Positive,1
you sort of automatically assume,0.0,Neutral,0
"that there are goals for its future,",0.0,Neutral,0
that it'll have another generation,0.0,Neutral,0
"and another one after that,",0.0,Neutral,0
and that there is some goal,0.0,Neutral,0
"for what this will turn
into 10 years down the road",-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
"because we saw what
happened with the iphone",0.0,Neutral,0
and the mac and the ipad,0.0,Neutral,0
"and all sorts of other
first generation products.",0.0625,Positive,1
"and on top of all of that, as
far as i know, apple has never",0.3,Positive,1
"released any other
first generation product",0.0625,Positive,1
"with the word pro already in the name,",0.0,Neutral,0
"which comes with a whole
nother set of implications.",0.2,Positive,1
so is the world ready for all of this?,0.2,Positive,1
let's get into it.,0.0,Neutral,0
upbeat music,0.0,Neutral,0
"so i might be one of the
20 people outside of apple",0.0,Neutral,0
who has been using the vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
the most over the past two weeks.,0.125,Positive,1
"like, i've spent hours in
this thing with both bands,",-0.1,Negative,0
"with multiple macs, in different
setups, different rooms,",0.0,Neutral,0
"indoors and outdoors,
lightness and darkness.",0.0,Neutral,0
"there are parts of this thing
that are absolutely amazing,",0.6000000000000001,Positive,1
"unparalleled, best i've ever seen.",1.0,Positive,1
but the reason it's so interesting,0.5,Positive,1
is because it's actually new,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
"and there are downfalls
and flaws and trade-offs",0.0,Neutral,0
that come alongside all of this stuff.,0.0,Neutral,0
"so at the end of the last video,",0.0,Neutral,0
i gave you guys a sort of a preview,0.0,Neutral,0
of my pros and cons list.,0.0,Neutral,0
"if you haven't already watched that video,",0.0,Neutral,0
"it is definitely worth watching,",0.3,Positive,1
almost like a prequel to this one.,0.0,Neutral,0
"it is a 30 minute monster all
about how to use this thing,",0.0,Neutral,0
"how it works, what's inside,
what it's capable of.",0.2,Positive,1
"and then, at the end, i got to my upsides,",0.0,Neutral,0
"which are immersiveness,
placement and space,",0.0,Neutral,0
"eye tracking and hand control,",0.0,Neutral,0
"passthrough, ecosystem, and spatial audio.",0.0,Neutral,0
"and the downsides, which
are weight and comfort,",0.0,Neutral,0
"the eyes on the outside,",0.0,Neutral,0
"app selection right now,
battery life, and price.",0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
"so, okay, for starters,",0.5,Positive,1
"i wanna amend immersiveness to fidelity,",0.0,Neutral,0
i think that's more accurate here.,0.45000000000000007,Positive,1
"i have used a bunch of
different vr headsets now,",0.0,Neutral,0
"and this vision pro has the sharpest,",0.0,Neutral,0
"best looking micro-oled
display out of all of them.",1.0,Positive,1
"the size of individual
pixels on these displays",0.0,Neutral,0
"is seven and a half microns,",-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
which means you could fit 64 of them,0.4,Positive,1
"in the size of a single
iphone screen's pixel.",-0.07142857142857142,Negative,0
"you can't see individual pixels,",0.0,Neutral,0
"there's no screen door
effect, it's awesome.",1.0,Positive,1
the native refresh rate is 90 hertz,0.0,Neutral,0
and it will crank up to 96 hertz,0.0,Neutral,0
"when there's 24 fps content
playing to be an even multiple.",0.0,Neutral,0
and apple says that they calibrate,0.0,Neutral,0
"every single one of
these vision pro displays",-0.07142857142857142,Negative,0
"from the factory for
maximum color accuracy.",0.0,Neutral,0
"they're really good,",0.7,Positive,1
"and this is a big reason why
this headset is so expensive.",-0.25,Negative,0
"but then, and this is gonna
be a recurring theme here,",0.0,Neutral,0
"the vision pro runs up against
the technology of today",0.0,Neutral,0
not being quite advanced enough,0.2,Positive,1
"to accomplish what they were
probably hoping as ideal.",0.9,Positive,1
"so in the case of these screens, right,",0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
"they're amazing, there are so many pixels,",0.55,Positive,1
"but because there's so many pixels,",0.5,Positive,1
"the computer inside cannot
actually render everything",0.0,Neutral,0
"in high resolution all
the time at 90 hertz.",0.16,Positive,1
"so instead, it does something clever.",0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
it combines the insanely fast eye tracking,0.2,Positive,1
"with what's called foveated rendering,",0.0,Neutral,0
"meaning, it's only actually
rendering in high resolution",0.05333333333333334,Positive,1
"exactly what you're looking
at when you're looking at it.",0.25,Positive,1
the rest is soft and fuzzy.,0.1,Positive,1
that actually works really well,0.1,Positive,1
because that's exactly how our eyes work.,0.25,Positive,1
"it's really clever, like
you don't think about it,",0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
"but the thing that you're looking
at at the moment is sharp,",-0.125,Negative,0
"but then the rest of
your peripheral vision",0.0,Neutral,0
"is soft and fuzzy, and that's fine.",0.25833333333333336,Positive,1
"so really, now, all of the
computing work is being done",0.2,Positive,1
to track your eyes as fast as possible,0.1,Positive,1
so that there's no lag between,0.0,Neutral,0
"when you look at something
and when it becomes sharp.",-0.125,Negative,0
"fun fact, you can actually see this",0.15,Positive,1
in screen recordings from the vision pro.,0.0,Neutral,0
you can see the piece of the screen,0.0,Neutral,0
"that i'm looking at is sharp,",-0.125,Negative,0
"and then everything else around it,",0.0,Neutral,0
"even parts of the same
window are fuzzy on purpose.",0.0,Neutral,0
"but to my eye, that looks totally natural",0.1,Positive,1
"because i'm focusing
on one thing at a time.",0.0,Neutral,0
i found that you can also screen record,0.0,Neutral,0
"with developer mode in xcode,
and that'll make the clips 4k",0.0,Neutral,0
"and it'll render everything
in hq all at once.",0.0,Neutral,0
"but every time i did that,",0.0,Neutral,0
"it would be choppy and scrolling
would be slow and jittery.",-0.25,Negative,0
and i'm thinking that's just because,0.0,Neutral,0
"the computers aren't really
used to rendering everything",0.2,Positive,1
in high quality all the time.,0.16,Positive,1
"so it looks like a
higher quality recording,",0.25,Positive,1
"but the second i did any
scrolling, it didn't look as good,",0.35,Positive,1
"so i just didn't use
those recordings as often.",0.0,Neutral,0
"so the screens are great,",0.8,Positive,1
"the position tracking of
objects and space are great,",0.8,Positive,1
the eye tracking is incredibly good.,0.7,Positive,1
"the one ding against immersion
on the vision pro though,",0.0,Neutral,0
"and not a lot of people
are talking about this,",0.0,Neutral,0
but it's the field of view.,0.0,Neutral,0
"see, the first few times
you use this headset,",0.024999999999999994,Positive,1
"you don't even really
think about it that much.",0.2,Positive,1
"you're so distracted by
all the fun and the newness",0.3,Positive,1
"and how cool it is that your
eyes are controlling the thing.",0.35,Positive,1
"but eventually, you start
to poke around the edges",0.0,Neutral,0
"and it turns out, you
know how people are saying",0.0,Neutral,0
"it kind of looks like ski
goggles from the outside?",0.3,Positive,1
"well, it also kind of
looks like ski goggles",0.6,Positive,1
from the inside a little bit too.,-0.1875,Negative,0
"again, the middle is super
sharp and incredibly impressive,",0.3020833333333333,Positive,1
"but if i can do my best here
through a youtube video,",1.0,Positive,1
"the edges of the headset
are a little bit further in",-0.09375,Negative,0
than the edges of your vision.,0.0,Neutral,0
"and so, there's a little bit
of like a cone effect going on",-0.1875,Negative,0
"and there's some chromatic
aberration around the outside.",0.0,Neutral,0
so you kind of have this slight feeling,0.21666666666666667,Positive,1
"of looking into a large
tunnel at everything.",0.21428571428571427,Positive,1
"there are actually no
field of view numbers",0.0,Neutral,0
"published by apple
anywhere about vision pro,",0.0,Neutral,0
"as far as i can tell,",0.1,Positive,1
and i kind of think that's on purpose,0.6,Positive,1
"because i have noticed
from using them both",0.0,Neutral,0
"that the quest 3 has a
better, wider field of view",0.5,Positive,1
just looking inside the headset.,0.0,Neutral,0
"so if i could change one
thing about the vision pro",0.0,Neutral,0
"to make it more immersive,",0.5,Positive,1
"it would be a wider field
of view, no question.",0.0,Neutral,0
upbeat music,0.0,Neutral,0
"vision pro has the best
passthrough of any headset",1.0,Positive,1
"i've ever used, that much
is super clear to me,",0.21666666666666667,Positive,1
"and weirdly enough,",0.0,Neutral,0
this doesn't actually surprise me either.,0.0,Neutral,0
maybe because this is one of the products,0.0,Neutral,0
that makes it so obvious,0.0,Neutral,0
"that they're thinking
a lot about the future,",0.0,Neutral,0
like apple talks a lot about ar,0.0,Neutral,0
and how they want things to just be clear,0.10000000000000002,Positive,1
"and just overlaying things
onto your real world.",0.2,Positive,1
"but with today's technology,",0.0,Neutral,0
"again, that's not quite possible yet.",0.0,Neutral,0
"so instead they have a vr headset,",0.0,Neutral,0
"but they are using the highest
quality camera feeds possible",0.0,Neutral,0
"and the highest quality
displays on the inside possible",0.0,Neutral,0
to let you almost feel like,0.0,Neutral,0
"you're looking through
it at the real world.",0.2,Positive,1
"so you put this headset on,",0.0,Neutral,0
"and the first thing
you see is passthrough,",0.25,Positive,1
"i mean, you might as well
call it transparency mode.",-0.3125,Negative,0
and the sharpness and the colors,0.0,Neutral,0
and the very low latency are all so good,0.35,Positive,1
"that i really don't
experience any eye fatigue,",0.2,Positive,1
"no matter how long i am
in this passthrough mode,",-0.05,Negative,0
"despite my eyes being
inches from these screens,",0.0,Neutral,0
"i can interact with the
real world around me,",0.2,Positive,1
"pick things up and look at them,",0.0,Neutral,0
"i can walk around, between
rooms and not trip on things.",0.0,Neutral,0
i tried having people throw things at me,0.0,Neutral,0
and i could just catch them.,0.0,Neutral,0
"i played table tennis
successfully with the headset on,",0.75,Positive,1
which is crazy if you think about,-0.6,Negative,0
what's actually happening here.,0.0,Neutral,0
"the total latency apple
says is 12 milliseconds,",0.0,Neutral,0
"that's from the outside light
hitting the outside sensors",0.13333333333333333,Positive,1
"to the inside image being updated
and hitting your eyeballs,",0.0,Neutral,0
"that's incredibly fast,",0.2,Positive,1
"and that includes the
exposure time of the cameras.",0.0,Neutral,0
"that's the specially
designed r1 chip at work.",0.35714285714285715,Positive,1
"but, as nilay from the verge has put it,",0.0,Neutral,0
"it's still cameras and screens,",0.0,Neutral,0
like the technology of today isn't magic.,0.5,Positive,1
"so you still have to
expose a camera sensor",0.0,Neutral,0
"and set iso and shutter speed, et cetera,",0.0,Neutral,0
"and you can kind of play
around with this a bit",0.6,Positive,1
"just by looking around
like at bright objects",0.7000000000000001,Positive,1
or high dynamic range environments.,0.08,Positive,1
"and you know what,",0.0,Neutral,0
"for the variety of situations
i've thrown at this thing,",0.0,Neutral,0
"it's handled it very
impressively the whole time,",0.6,Positive,1
"mostly prioritizing smoothness
and high shutter speeds",0.33,Positive,1
at the expense of cranking up the iso,0.0,Neutral,0
"and getting way more noise,",0.5,Positive,1
especially in darker environments.,0.0,Neutral,0
but you can still see stuff,0.0,Neutral,0
like the hand occlusion breaks sometimes,0.0,Neutral,0
"or look really janky
when you put your hand",0.2,Positive,1
in front of something.,0.0,Neutral,0
"you can still see objects start
to float a little bit more",0.15625,Positive,1
"in x, y, and z space when
you're in much lower lighting,",0.2,Positive,1
as opposed to the usual perfect position.,0.375,Positive,1
"again, it's the best i've
ever seen with today's tech,",1.0,Positive,1
"but it definitely still
has a long way to go.",-0.025,Negative,0
upbeat music,0.0,Neutral,0
"so honestly, the
ecosystem is, i would say,",0.6,Positive,1
"the strongest argument
for a regular person",0.0,Neutral,0
"going out and buying today's
version of the vision pro.",0.0,Neutral,0
"like, every time a new big
product comes out or whatever,",0.06818181818181818,Positive,1
"i get like texts from people,",0.0,Neutral,0
"""oh hey, marques, you know,",0.0,Neutral,0
"i know you already made like
a 30 minute video about it",0.0,Neutral,0
"and like unboxed it and did all that,",0.0,Neutral,0

think about the vision pro?",0.2,Positive,1
"like, is it good enough?
should i get one?""",0.35,Positive,1
"and, truthfully, probably not.",0.5,Positive,1
"but i will say that there
are a good amount of things",0.7,Positive,1
"that i do specifically look
forward to using for it,",0.0,Neutral,0
"and most of those things
are ecosystem related.",0.25,Positive,1
"so obviously there's the
built-in apps, right?",0.14285714285714285,Positive,1
"imessage works perfectly,",1.0,Positive,1
"just like any iphone or
ipad on your account,",0.0,Neutral,0
"photos are all loaded up in
here straight from your iphone.",0.2,Positive,1
this is clearly the headset,0.10000000000000002,Positive,1
"that is best for iphone
users, apple ecosystem people,",1.0,Positive,1
"but also, little things
too, like continuity.",-0.1875,Negative,0
"so i can copy some text
on my mac or my iphone",0.0,Neutral,0
"and then hit paste and it
shows up in the vision pro.",0.0,Neutral,0
"but there's two really
impressive ones to me",1.0,Positive,1
"for very different specific reasons,",0.0,Neutral,0
facetime and mac virtual display.,0.0,Neutral,0
"see, facetime is the most only
apple could ship this thing",0.25,Positive,1
i've seen in a long time.,-0.05,Negative,0
"from the personas scanned
in from the cameras",0.0,Neutral,0
"on the front of the headset
to the positional tracking",0.0,Neutral,0
"and responsiveness of the spatial audio,",0.0,Neutral,0
"it's all so well thought
out that, you know,",0.0,Neutral,0
once everyone on the call,0.0,Neutral,0
"gets past the initial
like, ""ah, what is this?""",-0.125,Negative,0
"the shock, the moment they first see",0.25,Positive,1
"the virtual version of you,",0.0,Neutral,0
"once they first get past that,",0.0,Neutral,0
"then it actually kind
of slowly gets easier",0.14999999999999997,Positive,1
"and it feels way more
like a normal conversation",0.325,Positive,1
than a normal facetime.,0.15,Positive,1
"and it trades the
downside of not being able",0.5,Positive,1
"to hold up objects to
your camera for a button",0.0,Neutral,0
"that can switch to a real
time first person view",0.225,Positive,1
"where you can use both
hands instead of one.",0.0,Neutral,0
does the audio from these speakers,0.0,Neutral,0
still bleed out into the rest of the world,0.0,Neutral,0
"so anything over half
volume is incredibly audible",0.3666666666666667,Positive,1
to everyone in the room around you?,0.0,Neutral,0
"yeah, but does it also still
sound really, really impressive",0.7,Positive,1
for not actually being real headphones?,0.1,Positive,1
yeah.,0.0,Neutral,0
"but the other thing is
mac virtual display.",-0.125,Negative,0
"this is my number one favorite
feature of the vision pro,",0.5,Positive,1
even over like watching movies and stuff.,0.0,Neutral,0
"now, first of all,",0.25,Positive,1
"yes, you can already do
remote desktop viewing",-0.1,Negative,0
"on something like a quest 3,
it's great, i love that too.",0.65,Positive,1
but this one is way more interesting.,0.5,Positive,1
so this is connecting to your mac,0.0,Neutral,0
and then intaking and re-rendering,0.0,Neutral,0
"a new virtual display for your mac,",0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
"not mirroring what's already
being shown by your computer.",0.0,Neutral,0
"so you can use your mac with
all of its existing controls",0.0,Neutral,0
"you're already using with it,",0.0,Neutral,0
"but make your new monitor
literally as big as you want.",0.06818181818181818,Positive,1
"and then, you can open up
simultaneous vision pro apps",0.0,Neutral,0
all around that mac display,0.0,Neutral,0
"and place them all around
the room wherever you want,",0.0,Neutral,0
"over the walls, floating in midair,",0.0,Neutral,0
"pin them to other objects,
whatever, you can go nuts.",-0.125,Negative,0
"now, is this perfect?",1.0,Positive,1
"no, there are definitely trade-offs.",0.0,Neutral,0
"from even the little things,",-0.1875,Negative,0
like not being able to see your keyboard,0.5,Positive,1
"when you're in an immersive environment,",0.0,Neutral,0
to only being able to have,0.25,Positive,1
"a single virtual mac monitor at a time,",-0.07142857142857142,Negative,0
"to always having to look
where you're controlling,",0.0,Neutral,0
"i keep telling you guys,",0.0,Neutral,0
"there's definitely extra
brain cycles involved here.",0.0,Neutral,0
"but i do still think
that, despite all that,",0.0,Neutral,0
"this is my number one favorite
feature of this vision pro.",0.5,Positive,1
"the number one thing
that you can buy it for",0.0,Neutral,0
"and do that you couldn't do
with any other apple product.",-0.125,Negative,0
"i mean, it's the difference",-0.3125,Negative,0
between looking like this in a coffee shop,0.0,Neutral,0
or looking like this in a coffee shop.,0.0,Neutral,0
"pick your poison, i guess.",0.0,Neutral,0
i also had a moment where i was using,0.0,Neutral,0
"the vision pro for a
while and i had my mac",0.0,Neutral,0
"and some other monitors around me,",-0.125,Negative,0
"and then i took it off and
then i went and did something",0.0,Neutral,0
"and then i came back, and before
i put the headset back on,",0.0,Neutral,0
i looked up at the wall,0.0,Neutral,0
"to where i thought a window was gonna be,",0.0,Neutral,0
"but i hadn't, i hadn't...",0.0,Neutral,0
"i don't know if that says
more about the headset",0.5,Positive,1
or about me.,0.0,Neutral,0
upbeat music,0.0,Neutral,0
"but speaking of apps, we
gotta get into the weaknesses.",0.0,Neutral,0
and the app situation,0.0,Neutral,0
on vision pro right now is one of them.,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
"so this is the home
screen of the vision pro,",0.0,Neutral,0
"it has all of your apps,
you can't rearrange them,",0.0,Neutral,0
it's always alphabetical.,0.0,Neutral,0
and this is a developing situation,0.0,Neutral,0
"that will record and improve over time,",0.0,Neutral,0
"but as of right now, as i
record this on launch day,",0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
"there are literally 600 apps
made for the vision pro.",0.0,Neutral,0
"and that sounds like a lot at first,",0.25,Positive,1
but then kind of not a lot.,0.6,Positive,1
there are also the millions of other apps,-0.125,Negative,0
that are made for the ipad,0.0,Neutral,0
"that are compatible with the
vision pro that will show up.",0.0,Neutral,0
"but there's 600 apps made
specifically for the vision pro.",0.0,Neutral,0
"the few apps that are showing
up here are pretty incredible,",0.31666666666666665,Positive,1
"and they all kind of find
unique and creative ways",0.4916666666666667,Positive,1
to take advantage of the 3d space.,0.0,Neutral,0
"and i fully believe the
rest of the developers",0.0,Neutral,0
"are also kind of still trying
to figure out what to do",0.6,Positive,1
"with the 3d space in their own apps,",0.6,Positive,1
"or even if it makes sense
to do anything at all",0.0,Neutral,0
beyond the normal ipad app.,0.15,Positive,1
"but at this point right now today,",0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
"i honestly believe that
there are way more cool ideas",0.4833333333333334,Positive,1
"about vr and ar experiences
than there are actual apps.",0.0,Neutral,0
"now, don't get me wrong,
there are some cool apps,",-0.07500000000000001,Negative,0

some in the past video,",-0.25,Negative,0
there are some more in this video,0.5,Positive,1
"and there will be more
of them pop up every day.",0.5,Positive,1
"but have you seen that video
of gamifying vacuum cleaning",-0.008333333333333333,Negative,0
so that you can actually,0.0,Neutral,0
cover your entire floor space like a game?,-0.2,Negative,0
"it's not a real app, but if it was,",-0.1,Negative,0
"it would be pretty sick
and i would totally use it.",-0.15476190476190477,Negative,0
or maybe you've seen that other video,-0.125,Negative,0
"of watching an f1 race in
vision pro, it is so sick,",-0.7142857142857143,Negative,0
"it's like there's a virtual
track overlaid into your space",0.0,Neutral,0

everything happening at once,",0.0,Neutral,0
"plus the times and, you
know, smaller video feeds",0.0,Neutral,0
"of the battles around
different points of the track.",0.0,Neutral,0
this looks genuinely better than,0.5,Positive,1
"the actual tv broadcast experience,",0.0,Neutral,0
"but it's also not a real app
yet, it's just a concept.",-0.1,Negative,0
and i've seen all kinds of other stuff,-0.125,Negative,0
and i wanna watch an nba game court side,-0.4,Negative,0
"in the vision pro too,",0.0,Neutral,0

seem to exist yet either.",0.0,Neutral,0

jumping into this new space",0.13636363636363635,Positive,1

"oh, okay, the tech is gonna
start to get better now,",0.5,Positive,1
"this sort of unlocked
this new creative layer",0.3181818181818182,Positive,1
"for people to dream of
new ar and vr experiences,",0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
and it'll be up to developers,0.0,Neutral,0
"to actually make that
stuff happen over time,",0.0,Neutral,0
"with the constraints
of today's technology.",0.0,Neutral,0
"but as of right now, not a lot of apps,",0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
"also, no youtube app, no netflix app,",0.0,Neutral,0
"there's no spotify app,
there's no tiktok app yet.",0.0,Neutral,0
"i hope that apple can sort
of patch up the relationship",0.0,Neutral,0
"with these developers
because getting those apps",0.0,Neutral,0
will make this a better product.,0.5,Positive,1

"that is definitely a weakness
of this first gen product.",0.125,Positive,1
upbeat music,0.0,Neutral,0
"all right, i'm not the only
one who's been saying this,",0.14285714285714285,Positive,1
"but this is not the
most comfortable headset",0.45,Positive,1
and i figured out why.,0.0,Neutral,0
"so first of all, everyone's
mentioned the weight,",0.25,Positive,1
"and it's true, it does weigh like 25% more",0.425,Positive,1
than a lot of other headsets.,-0.125,Negative,0
"like, take the quest 3, for example,",0.0,Neutral,0
"probably the most popular
one, familiar to most people,",0.49375,Positive,1
"that's mostly plastic
and it weighs 515 grams.",0.5,Positive,1
"so vision pro being made of
metal and having all this glass,",0.0,Neutral,0
"weighing in at nearly 650 grams,",0.1,Positive,1
it kind of seems like apple,0.6,Positive,1
just didn't care about the weight.,0.0,Neutral,0
but i don't think that's the case.,0.0,Neutral,0
"matter of fact, if you've
seen the tear downs",0.0,Neutral,0
or if you've seen what's inside,0.0,Neutral,0
"this little computer here on your face,",-0.1875,Negative,0
this is built incredibly efficiently.,0.9,Positive,1
"there's carbon fiber in here, magnesium,",0.0,Neutral,0
all sorts of other lightweight materials.,-0.125,Negative,0
"now there's still lots
of obvious heft on it,",0.0,Neutral,0
"but 25% more weight
shouldn't be the difference",0.5,Positive,1
"between comfortable and, like,
i need to do neck exercises.",0.4,Positive,1
"no, the problem is this strap,",0.0,Neutral,0
"this is the solo knit strap,",0.0,Neutral,0
"this is the strap that's
in all the commercials",0.0,Neutral,0
that everybody sees.,0.0,Neutral,0
"this is what's on apple's website,",0.0,Neutral,0
"it's in all the apple stores
because it looks so cool.",0.35,Positive,1
"and i think when apple was
probably first deciding,",0.25,Positive,1
"okay, we are gonna get into
this vr headset market,",0.5,Positive,1
how do we differentiate ourselves?,0.0,Neutral,0
"we gotta reinvent a few things,",-0.2,Negative,0
like the input method and all this stuff.,0.0,Neutral,0
"i think they thought the
strap had to be one of them,",0.0,Neutral,0
and that's how we got this thing.,0.0,Neutral,0
"and i think dave2d was spot
on in his recent video,",0.0,Neutral,0
"vr headsets just kind of all look dumb,",0.11249999999999999,Positive,1
"and the straps on them are all
so universally lame looking.",-0.5,Negative,0
"and this strap is just so much cooler,",0.2,Positive,1
"you put it on, it's
the quickest to adjust,",0.0,Neutral,0
it messes up your hair the least.,-0.3,Negative,0
"it obviously has this
little adjustment thing",-0.09375,Negative,0
"on the outside so you
can scroll this wheel",0.0,Neutral,0
"and satisfyingly like tighten
the cables inside like this.",0.5,Positive,1
this must have taken a lot of r&d,0.0,Neutral,0
to get this thing to look iconic,0.5,Positive,1
"and actually be functional, this is sick.",-0.35714285714285715,Negative,0
"but when you put it on,",0.0,Neutral,0
"you sort of tighten it up
against the front of your face",0.0,Neutral,0
"and it's squeezing it
up against your face,",0.0,Neutral,0
"all of the weight, up at the front",0.0,Neutral,0
"against basically these
two pressure points,",0.0,Neutral,0
"right above your eyes
and right on your cheeks.",0.19047619047619047,Positive,1
"and the more you tighten
it to prevent light leak,",0.45,Positive,1
the more uncomfortable it gets.,0.0,Neutral,0
"and it's just, it's so hard to wear this",-0.2916666666666667,Negative,0
"for more than about 30, 45 minutes.",0.5,Positive,1
"after 45 minutes, i really
do need to take this off.",0.2,Positive,1
so it's not your neck as much as,0.2,Positive,1
"it's just all the pressure
on the front of your face.",0.0,Neutral,0
"and apple knows this,",0.0,Neutral,0
"and that's why they've included
in the box this second band,",0.0,Neutral,0
"this is the dual loop band,",0.0,Neutral,0
"and it's super easy to pop this
one off and pop this one on.",0.3833333333333333,Positive,1
"now it's not as cool
looking as a solo knit band,",0.35,Positive,1
and it's going to mess up your hair,-0.175,Negative,0
"more than a solo knit band,",0.5,Positive,1
"and it's not as easy to
adjust as a solo knit band.",0.43333333333333335,Positive,1
you're literally like trying to find,0.0,Neutral,0
"and attach velcro blindly
at the top of your head.",0.0,Neutral,0
"basically, it's almost as lame looking",-0.5,Negative,0
as every other vr headset strap.,-0.125,Negative,0
"but it turns out they all
look like this for a reason,",0.0,Neutral,0
"and oh my god, is it so much better",0.5,Positive,1
for wearing it for a long time.,-0.05,Negative,0
i just recently did the last episode,0.0,Neutral,0
"of the ""waveform podcast"",",0.0,Neutral,0
you can go subscribe over there.,0.0,Neutral,0
"i wore the headset for the entire thing,",0.0,Neutral,0
"a two hour recording,",0.0,Neutral,0
"and i could never have done
that with the solo knit band,",0.0,Neutral,0
"and that's because it's
taking a ton of the pressure",0.0,Neutral,0
"off of the front of your
face and taking the weight",0.0,Neutral,0
"and using the top of your
head to support it instead.",0.5,Positive,1
it's so much better.,0.5,Positive,1
so if you're gonna just hand the headset,0.0,Neutral,0
"to someone to use it
for like five minutes,",0.0,Neutral,0
the solo knit band is great,0.8,Positive,1
"'cause it's super quick,
doesn't mess up their hair,",0.1638888888888889,Positive,1
"easy to adjust, boom.",0.43333333333333335,Positive,1
but if you plan on using this thing,0.0,Neutral,0
"for an extensive period of time, yeah,",0.0,Neutral,0
the dual loop band is 100% the way to go.,0.0,Neutral,0
upbeat music,0.0,Neutral,0
"so i don't know if the eyes
on the outside of this headset",0.0,Neutral,0
are actually accomplishing,0.0,Neutral,0
"what apple probably
wanted them to accomplish.",0.0,Neutral,0

to what we expect vision pro",-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
"to be in the future, see through
glasses, way down the line.",-0.07777777777777779,Negative,0

possible with today's tech,",0.0,Neutral,0

is a lenticular display",0.0,Neutral,0

point, i've tried my eyes,",0.0,Neutral,0
but also everyone else here at the studio,0.0,Neutral,0

in and tried eyesight,",0.0,Neutral,0

"like, the smooth glass of the headset",0.4,Positive,1
is so incredibly reflective,0.9,Positive,1

some light bouncing off it",0.4,Positive,1
in a way that makes the eyes hard to see.,-0.2916666666666667,Negative,0
"and even if you can see it,",0.0,Neutral,0
"it's pretty low resolution,",0.125,Positive,1

contact most of the time,",0.25,Positive,1

"what you might have seen in the ads,",0.0,Neutral,0
especially for darker skin tones.,0.0,Neutral,0

thinking about this like,",0.0,Neutral,0

what i think i expected",0.0,Neutral,0

"does apple in the next
generation vision pro",0.0,Neutral,0
"double down on eyesight
or do they get rid of it?",-0.07777777777777779,Negative,0
"and i think they have to keep it,",0.0,Neutral,0
"like it's such an iconic
part of the headset",0.25,Positive,1

so it's gotta be there.,0.0,Neutral,0

the first thing about the displays,0.25,Positive,1

"apple won't tell me the exact number,",0.25,Positive,1

"with a silly external
battery pack, isn't the goal.",-0.25,Negative,0

the vision pro is great.",0.8,Positive,1
it works. it's convincing.,0.5,Positive,1

12 milliseconds of latency",0.0,Neutral,0

this is the vision pro and apple doesn't,0.0,Neutral,0
really want you to buy it almost every,0.2,Positive,1
tech product that has ever come out you,0.0,Neutral,0
know that the company has first thought,0.25,Positive,1
what's the selling point either a key,0.0,Neutral,0
problem that it's fixing or just a clear,0.10000000000000002,Positive,1
reason that you would want to buy one,0.0,Neutral,0
and so almost consistently when you get,0.25,Positive,1
a first generation product in a new,0.19318181818181818,Positive,1
category it's still going to have those,0.0,Neutral,0
one or two key selling features cuz,0.0,Neutral,0
they're necessary for it to be a success,0.15,Positive,1
but then it's also going to be,0.0,Neutral,0
incredibly rough around the edges,-0.1,Negative,0
because the company has prioritized,0.0,Neutral,0
those as opposed to making sure that all,0.5,Positive,1
the little granular things are right but,0.04910714285714285,Positive,1
with the vision pro maybe the biggest,0.0,Neutral,0
product in the company's entire history,0.0,Neutral,0
i think it's kind of the opposite i mean,0.09583333333333333,Positive,1
apple are masters of marketing you know,0.0,Neutral,0
how they carefully curate the sprinkle,-0.1,Negative,0
of new features that each and every new,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
iphone comes with to make sure that,0.5,Positive,1
you're always wanting to keep moving up,0.0,Neutral,0
that ladder if this company wanted to,0.0,Neutral,0
they could absolutely sell you on this,0.2,Positive,1
product but i don't think they're trying,0.0,Neutral,0
to the vision pro released in the us,0.0,Neutral,0
only with a,0.0,Neutral,0
"35,000 price tag it has no real killer",-0.1,Negative,0
app it has no blockbuster augmented,0.0,Neutral,0
reality game and instead of those one or,-0.4,Negative,0
two key headline features it actually,0.0,Neutral,0
focuses instead on doing all those,0.0,Neutral,0
little things really well the things,0.0062500000000000056,Positive,1
that far fewer people are going to,0.1,Positive,1
notice and far fewer people are going to,0.1,Positive,1
buy it for why well i think the only,0.0,Neutral,0
reason apple has made this product is,0.0,Neutral,0
for developers that they're placing a,0.0,Neutral,0
bet that the future of consumer tech is,0.0,Neutral,0
veering towards headsets and so by,0.0,Neutral,0
making one absolutely banging piece of,0.2,Positive,1
hardware that sells devs on this vision,0.0,Neutral,0
of the future and by banking on the high,0.08,Positive,1
confidence that people already have an,0.0,Neutral,0
apple product succeeding it's going to,0.0,Neutral,0
make those devs start scurrying to build,0.0,Neutral,0
apps for this platform potentially even,0.0,Neutral,0
making it the default vr platform before,0.0,Neutral,0
most of its competitors have even,0.5,Positive,1
properly taken a stab it that said we're,0.0,Neutral,0
now a month into launch i've been using,0.0,Neutral,0
this for work for play for travel and,0.0,Neutral,0
this product scares me both in terms of,0.0,Neutral,0
its monstrous and i mean monstrous,-0.3125,Negative,0
potential but also with its,0.0,Neutral,0
consequences so let's start with the,0.0,Neutral,0
good like i know that a lot of people,0.7,Positive,1
are saying the facetime is weird the way,-0.5,Negative,0
this headset scans your face and creates,0.0,Neutral,0
this avatar for you feels creepy and,-0.5,Negative,0
uncanny valley and i don't completely,0.1,Positive,1
disagree with that but in my mind it's,0.0,Neutral,0
not a bad thing see if you plotted a,0.3499999999999999,Positive,1
graph of the realism of a character,0.0,Neutral,0
against how acceptable they look you'll,0.0,Neutral,0
get this people are completely okay with,0.5,Positive,1
something that's distinctly unrealistic,-0.5,Negative,0
it actually becomes even better when,0.25,Positive,1
that character gets more detailed and,0.45,Positive,1
the animations improve but then as soon,0.0,Neutral,0
as you hit a certain point of being,0.21428571428571427,Positive,1
close to real but not quite we hate it,-0.30000000000000004,Negative,0
it's creepy it feels possessed and if i,-0.5,Negative,0
had to pinpoint where the apple vision,0.0,Neutral,0
pro avatars currently sit it is around,0.0,Neutral,0
here so as far as actually using this to,0.05,Positive,1
join a business meeting or facetime your,0.0,Neutral,0
mom i don't think she'll be best pleased,0.75,Positive,1
i think she'll tell you to take that,0.0,Neutral,0
bluming helmet off or once but as a,0.0,Neutral,0
showcase of progress i think this is a,0.0,Neutral,0
big deal that on this graph we've pretty,0.125,Positive,1
much leap frog all away from here to,0.2,Positive,1
here this is so far ahead of even last,0.05,Positive,1
year's metaverse avatars that it,0.0,Neutral,0
genuinely makes them look like a prank,0.4,Positive,1
and yes we are at an uncomfortable stage,-0.5,Negative,0
right now but we had to get here at some,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
point on the way to true realism so why,0.35,Positive,1
not get it over with with a us only gen,0.0,Neutral,0
one product and also it is really,0.2,Positive,1
freeing now that you can actually video,0.0,Neutral,0
call someone without needing to get,0.0,Neutral,0
dressed up without needing to hold,0.0,Neutral,0
anything or find a surface to prop your,0.0,Neutral,0
phone up with and knowing that they can,0.0,Neutral,0
hear you with genuinely studio quality,0.4,Positive,1
audio it sounds better than this mic,0.5,Positive,1
here and see you front and center at all,-0.1,Negative,0
times it's meant that i've been able to,0.5,Positive,1
talk to people while cooking while,0.0,Neutral,0
packing bags while walking on the street,0.0,Neutral,0
and i feel the same way about this whole,0.1,Positive,1
eyesight feature you know the way that,0.0,Neutral,0
other people can see your eyes through,-0.125,Negative,0
the headset right now it does not,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
achieve its objective of making it less,-0.08333333333333333,Negative,0
socially awkward to film in front of,-0.6,Negative,0
people i'm wearing one of these around,0.0,Neutral,0
london on planes in ubers coffee shops i,0.0,Neutral,0
have never had as much side eye in my,0.2,Positive,1
entire life you can tell that every,0.0,Neutral,0
single person you walk past is trying,-0.1607142857142857,Negative,0
their absolute hardest to not turn and,0.2,Positive,1
stare at you but also that that's,0.0,Neutral,0
exactly what they want to do i've had,0.25,Positive,1
people call me all sorts of things like,0.0,Neutral,0
take off that headset you i'll let you,0.0,Neutral,0
fill in the blanks but the point is,0.0,Neutral,0
right now you look like a donut wearing,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
this in public and that's probably,0.0,Neutral,0
partly because the eyes need to be,0.0,Neutral,0
brighter and the outer plastic area gets,0.0,Neutral,0
lots of reflections but i do think that,0.0,Neutral,0
the main thing is just the fact that,0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
it's new the idea of this is not,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
currently considered acceptable but as,0.0,Neutral,0
an actual concept i do think that,0.0,Neutral,0
eyesight is a super intelligent solution,0.5666666666666667,Positive,1
to the problem of others being,0.0,Neutral,0
completely unaware of what you're,0.0,Neutral,0
looking at like yeah it's kind of a,0.6,Positive,1
waste of battery and yeah you could just,-0.2,Negative,0
stick some leds on the outside a green,-0.1,Negative,0
one to let people know that you can see,0.0,Neutral,0
them and a red one to let them know,0.0,Neutral,0
you're recording but this does at least,-0.3,Negative,0
make those interactions feel a little,-0.1875,Negative,0
bit more humanlike at least you know as,0.1,Positive,1
much as they can when you've got a 200,0.2,Positive,1
in screen between,0.0,Neutral,0
you now at its core the apple vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
is a virtual reality headset it's not,0.0,Neutral,0
dissimilar to products like the meta,0.0,Neutral,0
quest but for me at least it does do,-0.3,Negative,0
more of the fundamentals right than,0.39285714285714285,Positive,1
anyone else it's it's cushioned but airy,0.0,Neutral,0
it doesn't get clammmy or sweaty yes the,0.0,Neutral,0
headset is heavy and i do think apple,-0.2,Negative,0
should have added in the option for some,0.0,Neutral,0
sort of rigid strap like basically every,0.0,Neutral,0
vr headset comes with just to take off,0.0,Neutral,0
some of the clamping force from the,0.0,Neutral,0
front of your face and yes if you pay,0.0,Neutral,0
attention to it you of course can tell,0.0,Neutral,0
that this whole pass through thing is a,0.2,Positive,1
video feed that you're watching as,0.0,Neutral,0
opposed to your real eyes seeing the,0.2,Positive,1
real world with the motion blur and the,0.2,Positive,1
grain and the occasional sign flickering,0.0,Neutral,0
and the dynamic range and of course the,0.0,Neutral,0
headset's camera stabilization not being,0.0,Neutral,0
as good as the stabilization of your own,0.6499999999999999,Positive,1
eyes but no one has done it better than,0.5,Positive,1
this the resolution the latency the,0.0,Neutral,0
color signs so much workers have to go,0.2,Positive,1
into this and it's a lot harder than it,-0.1,Negative,0
seems it's like shooting a video all the,0.0,Neutral,0
time but with higher stakes because all,0.25,Positive,1
of a sudden you can't have sudden,0.0,Neutral,0
changes in exposure the perspective has,0.0,Neutral,0
to match that of your eyes there needs,0.0,Neutral,0
to be none of the distortion that you,0.0,Neutral,0
would normally get with wide camera,0.024999999999999994,Positive,1
lenses like this and also there can't be,0.0,Neutral,0
a delay between when things happen and,0.0,Neutral,0
when you see them and apple has done all,0.0,Neutral,0
of those things in a proficient enough,0.0,Neutral,0
way that in most lighting conditions,0.5,Positive,1
your brain can just tune it out and,0.0,Neutral,0
genuinely convince yourself of the,0.4,Positive,1
illusion that you are placing digital,0.0,Neutral,0
objects into your real world and that is,0.2,Positive,1
a massive achievement and that is,0.0,Neutral,0
complimented by the fact that the user,0.0,Neutral,0
interface is beautiful icons for example,0.85,Positive,1
are completely flat until you look at,-0.025,Negative,0
them and then the various different,0.0,Neutral,0
layers separate and you get depth,0.0,Neutral,0
there's no dark or light mode it is all,0.23750000000000002,Positive,1
about glass here which makes it even,0.0,Neutral,0
more immersive because you're seeing,0.5,Positive,1
bits of your room or your sky or your,0.0,Neutral,0
scene behind your apps oh and the,-0.4,Negative,0
shadows i love the shadows how the,0.5,Positive,1
windows cast a little bit of darkness on,-0.1875,Negative,0
the floor how letters cast darkness on,0.0,Neutral,0
your walls and the hand occlusion is,0.0,Neutral,0
absolutely phenomenal most headsets like,0.5,Positive,1
this they can place objects within the,0.0,Neutral,0
room that you're sitting in but that,0.0,Neutral,0
illusion breaks the second you lift your,0.0,Neutral,0
hands up cuz your hands will appear,0.0,Neutral,0
behind the window that the headset is,-0.4,Negative,0
trying to make you think is sitting 3 m,0.0,Neutral,0
from your face but this scans your hand,0.0,Neutral,0
hands in real time at all times such,0.1,Positive,1
that anytime you eclipse a window it,0.0,Neutral,0
cuts out a little bit of that window,-0.1875,Negative,0
around your hands so that your hands,0.0,Neutral,0
still appear like they're in front it,0.0,Neutral,0
isn't perfect but it's good enough so,0.5666666666666667,Positive,1
that as long as you're not staring at,-0.05,Negative,0
your hands the illusion is maintained,0.0,Neutral,0
using the apple vision pro is kind of,0.6,Positive,1
like that pipe dream we've always had of,0.0,Neutral,0
using transparent phones all the perks,0.0,Neutral,0
of that how unbelievably cool it feels,0.35,Positive,1
but none of the cons like the fact that,0.0,Neutral,0
you can't see your apps properly or,0.0,Neutral,0
reflections interfering with everything,0.0,Neutral,0
oh and the interaction model the way,0.0,Neutral,0
that your eyes are used to highlight,0.0,Neutral,0
things in your hands to select them i,0.0,Neutral,0
think this is going to get copied a lot,0.0,Neutral,0
i think it's going to become the,0.0,Neutral,0
industry standard so quickly that in a,0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
few years time it will just be well of,-0.2,Negative,0
course this is how headsets work and,0.0,Neutral,0
while of course the idea of big tech,0.0,Neutral,0
companies monitoring your eye movements,0.0,Neutral,0
is particularly scary it feels like,-0.5,Negative,0
apple has well addressed this issue,0.0,Neutral,0
essentially the ey tracking happens on,0.0,Neutral,0
one layer of software that exists,0.0,Neutral,0
completely on device so let's say you're,0.1,Positive,1
on tik tok and you're looking around tik,0.0,Neutral,0
tok does not see these hover effects,0.0,Neutral,0
they do not see the room you're sitting,0.0,Neutral,0
in and there's no way for them to access,0.0,Neutral,0
your persona all that stuff runs offline,0.0,Neutral,0
and your vision pro only tells the app,0.0,Neutral,0
the minimum amount it needs to know how,0.0,Neutral,0
to function and i got to say darting,0.0,Neutral,0
around your headset with your eyes like,0.0,Neutral,0
this and manipulating a room with a,0.0,Neutral,0
pinch of your fingers when it works it's,0.0,Neutral,0
pure wizardry yes there's work to be,0.21428571428571427,Positive,1
done on it and i still do personally,0.0,Neutral,0
find it a bit less satisfying than a,0.16666666666666669,Positive,1
phone screen partly because your phone's,0.0,Neutral,0
inputs are detected more accurately and,0.45000000000000007,Positive,1
partly because just hitting something,0.0,Neutral,0
physical it gives you something back as,0.0,Neutral,0
opposed to tapping and prodding and,0.0,Neutral,0
poking stuff in midair but the skeleton,0.0,Neutral,0
is in place in one go i think app has,0.0,Neutral,0
already set the precedent for the future,0.0,Neutral,0
now i've had some pretty major issues,0.15625,Positive,1
trying to use the vision pro for work,0.0,Neutral,0
i'm getting to that but one thing is,0.0,Neutral,0
undeniable the media experience you can,0.0,Neutral,0
get from this is oh my goodness part of,0.0,Neutral,0
it is the screens on the inside they're,0.0,Neutral,0
crisp the blacks are really black the,0.04166666666666667,Positive,1
colors are vivid and the brightness is,0.125,Positive,1
super high all of that matters but it's,0.24666666666666665,Positive,1
much more than that for those of you who,0.5,Positive,1
haven't managed to put one of these on,0.0,Neutral,0
yet let me describe it to you imagine,0.0,Neutral,0
you're in your living room you're,0.0,Neutral,0
sipping a cup of tea and you're reading,0.0,Neutral,0
a book and you decide you know i fancy,0.0,Neutral,0
watching something right now so you put,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
your vision pro on you drag in a,-0.1,Negative,0
high-end oled tv screen to whichever,0.0,Neutral,0
angle you find the most comfortable yes,0.45,Positive,1
even lying down looking directly up you,-0.02777777777777779,Negative,0
make that screen as big as you want like,0.0,Neutral,0
literally 200 in if you're into that and,0.0,Neutral,0
you hit play you want to darken your,0.0,Neutral,0
surroundings you don't need to go find a,0.0,Neutral,0
light switch your headset can do it you,0.4,Positive,1
want to change of scenery you turn this,0.0,Neutral,0
dial and you phase in the surface of the,0.0,Neutral,0
moon or literally any seat of you're,0.0,Neutral,0
choosing within a cinema and maybe the,0.0,Neutral,0
most underrated aspect of the whole,0.35,Positive,1
thing is the 3d because each of your,0.0,Neutral,0
eyes here has its own screen any 3d,0.6,Positive,1
movie this can create that effect and,0.0,Neutral,0
the way this thing represents that 3d,0.0,Neutral,0
content is it hands down the best,0.4222222222222222,Positive,1
experience i've ever had if i could pick,0.0,Neutral,0
between watching movies on this or going,0.0,Neutral,0
to the cinema on my own and wearing,0.6,Positive,1
those cheap glasses that darken and,0.4,Positive,1
already not that bright projector even,0.7000000000000001,Positive,1
if i was getting paid to go to the,0.0,Neutral,0
cinema i would pick the vision pro if,0.0,Neutral,0
you're on a flight in a cramped economy,0.0,Neutral,0
cabin put some good earphones in your,0.7,Positive,1
ears put this on your face and you can,0.0,Neutral,0
genuinely escape it's probably actually,0.2,Positive,1
only a matter of time before someone,0.0,Neutral,0
makes an app that allows you to,0.0,Neutral,0
literally escape to a first class cabin,0.25,Positive,1
but whatever digital location you choose,0.0,Neutral,0
whether it's a desert or a united states,0.0,Neutral,0
national park you genuinely feel like,0.4,Positive,1
you are in your own world your own world,0.6,Positive,1
where there isn't a chance that anyone,0.0,Neutral,0
around you can see anything you're,0.0,Neutral,0
watching which is kind of weird at first,0.11666666666666665,Positive,1
when you're typing in passwords and you,0.0,Neutral,0
see that it's not censoring anything but,0.0,Neutral,0
the power of this product is it's as if,0.0,Neutral,0
you could pick up your high-end 80-in tv,0.0,Neutral,0
your apple tv box your surround sound,0.4,Positive,1
system and you could pack them into your,0.0,Neutral,0
ruck sack and be able to take them out,0.5,Positive,1
at any time you want without worrying,0.0,Neutral,0
about plugging them in or positioning,0.0,Neutral,0
them that's how powerful and unique a,0.3375,Positive,1
proposition this is i also thought the,0.0,Neutral,0
cameras are pretty interesting like how,0.375,Positive,1
good is this versus an iphone well not,0.7,Positive,1
quite as good which is a little sad,0.004166666666666652,Positive,1
since the vision pro has both more space,0.5,Positive,1
and a higher price bracket but i guess,0.25,Positive,1
it just wasn't apple's priority here,0.0,Neutral,0
it's different its photos are,0.0,Neutral,0
significantly worse than iphone photos,-0.4,Negative,0
and its videos are slightly worse but,-0.4,Negative,0
there is something very easy about,0.5633333333333334,Positive,1
taking a vision pro video the fact that,0.0,Neutral,0
it's always ready to record the fact,0.2,Positive,1
that it's carried by your face so both,0.0,Neutral,0
your hands are free and the spatial,0.4,Positive,1
aspect every photo and video you take on,0.0,Neutral,0
this has automatic depth it's kind of,0.6,Positive,1
like portrait mode but instead of being,0.0,Neutral,0
compressed into a flat 2d image you can,-0.025,Negative,0
actually experience that depth not a,0.0,Neutral,0
mind-blowing camera but a cool one and,0.35,Positive,1
finally the apps consider in how new of,0.06818181818181818,Positive,1
a platform this is i've actually been,0.0,Neutral,0
quite surprised by both how many apps,0.3,Positive,1
there are that are well optimized for it,0.0,Neutral,0
and also how quickly they get added it,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
feels like every time i boot the thing,0.0,Neutral,0
up there is something new to explore you,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
can dj and mash up songs you can look at,0.0,Neutral,0
and take apart fully to scale 3d models,0.0,Neutral,0
you can play augmented reality games,0.0,Neutral,0
there's no one killer apple feature and,0.0,Neutral,0
there are some very notable gaps too,0.65,Positive,1
like an augmented reality maps app or,0.0,Neutral,0
some kind of blockbuster immersive game,0.09999999999999998,Positive,1
but this is such a strong base to build,-0.12222222222222225,Negative,0
on that my mind is already spinning at,0.0,Neutral,0
what something like this could be,0.0,Neutral,0
capable of in just a few years it very,0.06666666666666667,Positive,1
much reminds me of you know in the first,0.225,Positive,1
iphone launched how steve jobs got on,0.0,Neutral,0
stage and he talked about how they were,0.0,Neutral,0
launching three groundbreaking things,0.0,Neutral,0
and then that all of those three things,0.0,Neutral,0
were actually just one thing this is,0.0,Neutral,0
that all over again it's like a dozen,0.0,Neutral,0
incredible new technologies all,0.5181818181818182,Positive,1
happening in one product the key,0.0,Neutral,0
difference being that now instead of,0.0,Neutral,0
apps running in two dimensions they're,0.0,Neutral,0
running in three dimensions fully taking,0.0,Neutral,0
into account the space that you're,0.0,Neutral,0
operating them in like you know that,0.0,Neutral,0
phone app that plants a tree every time,0.0,Neutral,0
you stick to your work goals well what,0.0,Neutral,0
if that tree gets planted and grows in,0.0,Neutral,0
real time on your actual desk or like,0.1,Positive,1
pokémon go all of a sudden that original,0.1875,Positive,1
trailer for it you know the one that,0.0,Neutral,0
looked like pure science fiction that is,0.21428571428571427,Positive,1
actually possible now i don't know about,0.0,Neutral,0
you but that well that would get me off,0.0,Neutral,0
the sofa and if you're enjoying this,0.5,Positive,1
video then a sub to the channel would be,0.0,Neutral,0
the,0.0,Neutral,0
awesome but it's not without issue,1.0,Positive,1
issues so let's go from the smallest to,0.0,Neutral,0
the biggest one of the first things,0.25,Positive,1
you'll notice is the app situation while,0.0,Neutral,0
like i just said there are lots of great,0.8,Positive,1
ones there's no netflix there's no,0.0,Neutral,0
spotify there's no youtube we're talking,0.0,Neutral,0
apps so ubiquitous that they're like the,0.0,Neutral,0
first things you would think to install,0.25,Positive,1
on any new machine if they're not,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
already pre-installed but here it's not,0.0,Neutral,0
just that you're not getting customade,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro apps these companies seem to,0.0,Neutral,0
have specifically decided to not even,0.0,Neutral,0
allow you to use the ipad versions of,0.0,Neutral,0
their apps which is the default for,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro and yeah you can use the,0.0,Neutral,0
websites but then you can't download,0.0,Neutral,0
your movies or songs like you can on the,0.0,Neutral,0
apps which pretty much renders your,0.225,Positive,1
vision pro useless while traveling,-0.5,Negative,0
unless you primarily use apple tv that,0.4,Positive,1
is and that actually leads me on to my,0.0,Neutral,0
second concern it's not a secret that,0.1,Positive,1
apple are the masters of lockin they,0.0,Neutral,0
don't just want you to use their phone,0.0,Neutral,0
they want you to have their watch their,0.0,Neutral,0
home speaker their mac pro wheels and,0.0,Neutral,0
they are the best company in the world,1.0,Positive,1
at achieving that apple ties each one of,0.0,Neutral,0
their products together so seamlessly,0.1,Positive,1
and at the same time basically ignores,0.0,Neutral,0
the ex existence of competing products,0.0,Neutral,0
which when you combine those two things,0.0,Neutral,0
together creates the apple universe a,0.0,Neutral,0
universe in which you use your apple,0.0,Neutral,0
airdrop to send files and you watch your,0.0,Neutral,0
apple tv shows and you use apple,0.0,Neutral,0
shareplay and facetime to connect with,0.0,Neutral,0
your friends everything just works and,0.0,Neutral,0
you feel like you're living in an apple,0.0,Neutral,0
commercial until either you or someone,0.0,Neutral,0
close to you tries to use something,-0.1,Negative,0
that's not apple and then it all breaks,0.0,Neutral,0
down and there's been a couple of times,-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
while using this vision pro where i have,0.0,Neutral,0
felt like i'm not sure i want that on my,-0.25,Negative,0
face because when you put this thing on,0.0,Neutral,0
it's a lot more than just using another,0.5,Positive,1
apple product your vision in the most,0.5,Positive,1
literal sense possible becomes apple's,0.0,Neutral,0
vision you see what apple has decided,0.0,Neutral,0
you see i noticed this for the first,0.25,Positive,1
time when i was watching something on,0.0,Neutral,0
disney plus and i wanted to send what i,0.0,Neutral,0
was looking at to drisha the apple,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro blocked me from doing that,0.0,Neutral,0
you try and record a quick clip of your,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
scene and it blacks out the show and i,0.0,Neutral,0
understand why like the same reason you,0.0,Neutral,0
can't screen record a tv show on your,0.0,Neutral,0
phone for piracy reasons but this is my,0.0,Neutral,0
vision there's something that feels,0.0,Neutral,0
incredibly intrusive about companies,0.9,Positive,1
deciding what you can and can't do with,0.0,Neutral,0
your eyes like if i was watching a movie,0.0,Neutral,0
in my living room on my own tv and i,0.6,Positive,1
want to pull out my phone to record a,0.0,Neutral,0
quick clip of that scene it might be,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
frowned upon by netflix but i can still,0.0,Neutral,0
do that but all of a sudden on this,0.0,Neutral,0
being told that i can't that i have no,0.0,Neutral,0
choice i just felt my first twinge of,0.25,Positive,1
that dystopian future that a lot of,0.0,Neutral,0
people fear one where companies are the,0.0,Neutral,0
ones in charge of your free will and you,0.4,Positive,1
notice this apple level of control in,0.0,Neutral,0
lots of other areas too like this thing,-0.125,Negative,0
refuses to let you both screen record or,0.0,Neutral,0
take video when you're in low light why,0.2,Positive,1
not just try like i can see the view,0.0,Neutral,0
from my headset and i think it looks,0.0,Neutral,0
fine but apple doesn't want you to and,0.4166666666666667,Positive,1
the only reason i can think of is that,0.0,Neutral,0
they don't think it would be a good,0.7,Positive,1
enough looking video and it may poorly,-0.2,Negative,0
represent the apple vision pro online,0.0,Neutral,0
but that's on me if it's a poor looking,-0.4,Negative,0
video i should be able to make that,0.5,Positive,1
decision the fact that the thing is,0.0,Neutral,0
portless apart from the power connector,0.0,Neutral,0
so if you want to send files to anything,0.0,Neutral,0
wireless oh and what's the easiest and,0.0,Neutral,0
best way to wirelessly send those files,1.0,Positive,1
to anything apple airdrop got it you,0.0,Neutral,0
want to video call your android buddies,0.0,Neutral,0
there's no whatsapp app i mean yeah you,-0.3125,Negative,0
could set up a zoom meeting but really,0.2,Positive,1
this is designed for facetime and you,0.0,Neutral,0
know that absolutely awesome ability to,1.0,Positive,1
sit yourself in an actual cinema and,0.0,Neutral,0
pick your seat from everything i can see,0.0,Neutral,0
that's for apple tv content only and,0.0,Neutral,0
there's absolutely no reason why that,-0.1,Negative,0
needed to be the case why not enable,0.0,Neutral,0
this feature for all content i'd love to,0.5,Positive,1
watch my youtube videos that way too,0.0,Neutral,0
instead of in safari what i'm saying is,0.0,Neutral,0
that there's no one thing that's,0.0,Neutral,0
outwardly wrong here it's just there are,-0.5,Negative,0
definitely the classic undertones of,0.08333333333333333,Positive,1
things being built for the apple users,0.0,Neutral,0
as opposed to things being built to be,0.0,Neutral,0
the best no matter what app you're using,1.0,Positive,1
and as someone who has just recently,0.0,Neutral,0
switched over to a samsung phone i,0.0,Neutral,0
definitely feel like i am at the butt of,0.0,Neutral,0
that joke but even more bothersome than,0.5,Positive,1
that is that the vision pro pro is not,0.0,Neutral,0
particularly great for work at least not,0.25,Positive,1
my work while it is very cool that you,0.45499999999999996,Positive,1
can mirror your laptop's display and,0.0,Neutral,0
make it bigger and place it anywhere and,0.0,Neutral,0
it's extremely thoughtless in how you,-0.125,Negative,0
start the feature you just stare at your,0.0,Neutral,0
laptop screen and hit connect it doesn't,0.0,Neutral,0
really add anything it's not like my mac,0.2,Positive,1
suddenly enters the virtual realm and i,0.0,Neutral,0
can start interacting with final cut pro,0.0,Neutral,0
through my headset it's just a screen,0.0,Neutral,0
within a screen you can't suddenly add,0.0,Neutral,0
in multiple monitors or turn your,0.0,Neutral,0
existing monitor into an ultrawide so i,0.0,Neutral,0
can't have my video editor open on one,0.0,Neutral,0
screen here and then the preview window,0.0,Neutral,0
over here which would be a value ad and,0.0,Neutral,0
working in this is not higher resolution,-0.125,Negative,0
either you still get a better resolution,0.5,Positive,1
out of a good quality monitor and yeah,0.7,Positive,1
you could say good quality monitors are,0.7,Positive,1
expensive but if you can afford one of,-0.5,Negative,0
these you can definitely afford one of,0.0,Neutral,0
those when i'm scripting while your,0.0,Neutral,0
macbook screen does reappear within the,0.0,Neutral,0
headset your keyboard does not so it's,0.0,Neutral,0
very hard to read meaning that unless,-0.3791666666666667,Negative,0
you're an aade touch typer writing is,0.0,Neutral,0
about to get significantly slower and,0.375,Positive,1
that's not even factoring in the,0.0,Neutral,0
slightly more fundamental issue that in,0.5,Positive,1
most computers your input device is,0.5,Positive,1
independent of where you're looking like,0.0,Neutral,0
most people don't look at the mouse for,0.5,Positive,1
example your hands just do it whereas,0.0,Neutral,0
here because the entire system,0.0,Neutral,0
navigation is your eyes while sometimes,0.0,Neutral,0
it can be way less effort sometimes it,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
can be a lot more there are times where,0.5,Positive,1
it feels like your mind is being read,0.0,Neutral,0
where like you're typing something and,0.0,Neutral,0
you think of the letters you're trying,0.0,Neutral,0
to type and as you do that your eyes,0.0,Neutral,0
naturally move to those letters and the,0.1,Positive,1
vision just knows and it feels like,0.0,Neutral,0
magic but at the same time i think we,0.25,Positive,1
naturally as humans we're always,0.1,Positive,1
thinking of the next thing so you will,0.0,Neutral,0
notice that by default your eyes will,0.0,Neutral,0
want to move on to something else as,0.0,Neutral,0
you're entering the last digit of your,0.0,Neutral,0
pin for example that is not really going,-0.1,Negative,0
to fly here because the vision pro,0.8,Positive,1
requires you to be looking exactly at,0.25,Positive,1
that input which leads to all sorts of,0.0,Neutral,0
weird situations where let's say you're,-0.5,Negative,0
deleting a bunch of text or trying to,0.0,Neutral,0
click the undo button many times if you,0.5,Positive,1
try and look up at the text that's being,0.0,Neutral,0
selected your vision pro is no longer,0.0,Neutral,0
selecting the delete key and so often,0.0,Neutral,0
times you will just stop deleting,0.0,Neutral,0
there's actually a whole load of small,-0.024999999999999994,Negative,0
kinks like this that clearly do need to,0.10000000000000002,Positive,1
be figured out in the second gen like,0.0,Neutral,0
trying to drink the vision pro camera's,0.0,Neutral,0
point of view is not quite the same as,0.0,Neutral,0
that of your eyes so sometimes you miss,0.0,Neutral,0
your mouth you get a notification on,0.0,Neutral,0
your phone and you want to check it well,0.0,Neutral,0
tough cameras don't focus nearly as,-0.14444444444444443,Negative,0
close as your eyes can so i guarantee it,0.0,Neutral,0
will be a strain the field of view is a,0.0,Neutral,0
little smaller than you'd expect so you,-0.09375,Negative,0
don't get the full peripheral vision,0.35,Positive,1
that you're used to there's a fair bit,0.7,Positive,1
of sound leakage so while you do have,0.4,Positive,1
complete privacy with what you're seeing,0.1,Positive,1
everyone in the room will hear it which,0.0,Neutral,0
is especially amusing for a headset like,1.0,Positive,1
this since it's the only thing they can,0.0,Neutral,0
experience don't get me wrong the,-0.5,Negative,0
hardware is incredible it's better than,0.7,Positive,1
anything i've used before but it's just,0.0,Neutral,0
when you try and put something on your,0.0,Neutral,0
face like this naturally it's competing,0.1,Positive,1
with your eyes and that it still isn't,0.0,Neutral,0
quite up to scratch with and that leads,0.0,Neutral,0
me onto i would say the biggest barrier,0.0,Neutral,0
towards this hitting,0.0,Neutral,0
mainstream it's kind of lonely in here,0.25,Positive,1
and that's not to say that shared,0.0,Neutral,0
experiences don't exist like if i'm,0.0,Neutral,0
facetiming a friend and i have them on,0.0,Neutral,0
one side and then a movie that we're,0.0,Neutral,0
both watching at the same time using,0.0,Neutral,0
share play over here it is actually the,0.0,Neutral,0
best experience i've ever had catching,0.8,Positive,1
up with people long distance but it's,-0.05,Negative,0
the people who are right in front of you,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
who feel it every time i hand the vision,0.0,Neutral,0
pro to someone to test it genuinely,0.4,Positive,1
feels like they've disappeared into,0.0,Neutral,0
their own world they'll be standing and,0.6,Positive,1
prodding the air not really paying,-0.1,Negative,0
attention to you or even able to hear,0.5,Positive,1
you properly and yeah the whole pass,0.1,Positive,1
through thing exists the person is,0.0,Neutral,0
somewhat aware of the room and who's in,0.25,Positive,1
it but you know they may well have,0.0,Neutral,0
literally planted a screen in front of,0.0,Neutral,0
your face talking to someone wearing one,0.0,Neutral,0
of these feels a lot like talking to,0.0,Neutral,0
someone who's doing this and that's if,0.0,Neutral,0
you can actually get it to work with,0.0,Neutral,0
other people when you order a vision pro,-0.125,Negative,0
there's a very advanced fitting process,0.51,Positive,1
that makes it essentially custom made,0.0,Neutral,0
for you this is why you almost,0.0,Neutral,0
definitely should not try and import one,0.0,Neutral,0
if you live outside the us because you,0.06818181818181818,Positive,1
likely won't get it fitted properly but,0.0,Neutral,0
anyway for me the one i have it fits,0.0,Neutral,0
great and the light seal and the eye,0.6000000000000001,Positive,1
tracking works incredibly but i haven't,0.9,Positive,1
had a single smooth handoff every single,0.08571428571428574,Positive,1
time i take this thing off to hand to,0.0,Neutral,0
someone else to try there's always some,0.0,Neutral,0
sort of issue that crops up whether it's,0.0,Neutral,0
because their eyes are further apart on,0.0,Neutral,0
their head or they normally wear glasses,0.15,Positive,1
or the strap won't tighten enough for,0.0,Neutral,0
the size of their head it's so,0.0,Neutral,0
cumbersome to actually show people,0.0,Neutral,0
things that after a while you just don't,0.0,Neutral,0
bother and that's a little sad now that,-0.34375,Negative,0
isn't specific to the apple vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
it's the same with all headsets but i,0.0,Neutral,0
would say that that is why even though,0.0,Neutral,0
we've already had multiple vr,0.0,Neutral,0
revolutions over the last few decades,-0.1,Negative,0
none of them have stuck so far it's,0.1,Positive,1
always been an incredible party trick,0.9,Positive,1
it's always blown everyone away when,0.0,Neutral,0
they first try it but then it gets,0.25,Positive,1
forgotten again when people realize that,0.0,Neutral,0
they can't use it to connect with the,0.0,Neutral,0
people who are close to them so if apple,0.0,Neutral,0
really does want it to stick this time,0.2,Positive,1
around that is the key problem they're,0.0,Neutral,0
going to need to solve solve and you can,0.0,Neutral,0
tell they're trying okay i do also worry,0.5,Positive,1
about what apple vision pro and products,0.0,Neutral,0
like it are going to do to our attention,0.0,Neutral,0
bans i don't think it's really an issue,0.2,Positive,1
in the state that the thing is in now,0.0,Neutral,0
since it's going to be a few people,-0.2,Negative,0
using it for a few hours a day mostly,0.15,Positive,1
for quite specific specialized tasks but,0.0,Neutral,0
bigger picture it could well be i mean i,-0.15625,Negative,0
see it in myself when i have periods of,0.0,Neutral,0
spending lots of time with my tech like,0.0,Neutral,0
all day scripting on the laptop or,0.0,Neutral,0
gaming on the couch music while in the,0.0,Neutral,0
gym filling every little gap of time,-0.1875,Negative,0
with a quick video to watch i feel,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
incredibly on edge i feel antsy and i,0.9,Positive,1
think it's because my body is used to,0.0,Neutral,0
persistent dopamine hits and it just,0.0,Neutral,0
wants them to keep coming and that is,0.2,Positive,1
not good for you it's counterintuitive,-0.35,Negative,0
but too much stimulation can quite,0.2,Positive,1
easily lead to a persistent feeling of,0.43333333333333335,Positive,1
stress and i've actually a couple of,0.0,Neutral,0
times started to get physical symptoms,0.0,Neutral,0
from that and the only thing that has,0.0,Neutral,0
ever helped me is to lock my phone away,0.0,Neutral,0
in a box for a few days and completely,-0.05,Negative,0
forget it exists i always think back to,0.0,Neutral,0
a quote i read over 10 years a ago that,0.0,Neutral,0
boredom is the precursor to creativity i,0.0,Neutral,0
think it's actually really healthy to be,0.5,Positive,1
bored once in a while because it's what,-0.5,Negative,0
grounds you but this i think this is the,0.0,Neutral,0
opposite of that this is anything you,0.0,Neutral,0
want in the entire world brought to you,0.0,Neutral,0
and being able to experience that in the,0.5,Positive,1
biggest way possible this is effectively,0.3,Positive,1
an anti-boredom device so what's my,0.0,Neutral,0
overall take on the vision pro well i,0.0,Neutral,0
think it's very exciting it's slightly,0.11166666666666668,Positive,1
scary and no one really needs one i've,-0.15,Negative,0
also seen a lot of comparison being,0.0,Neutral,0
drawn to this meta quest 3 which people,0.0,Neutral,0
are rightfully saying does a lot of what,0.0,Neutral,0
this does in fact honestly features wise,0.6499999999999999,Positive,1
this is more and the price difference is,0.5,Positive,1
wild,0.1,Positive,1
"3,499",0.0,Neutral,0
499 but they are two very different,0.0,Neutral,0
propositions like the meta is great for,0.8,Positive,1
gaming it's got a more mature ecosystem,0.3,Positive,1
the hardware is basically subsidized,0.0,Neutral,0
because meta wants it to be a mass,0.2,Positive,1
market product apple does not i think,0.0,Neutral,0
the vision pro is one day aiming to,0.0,Neutral,0
directly replace your computer it's more,0.3,Positive,1
powerful than the meta the screens are,0.3,Positive,1
sharper and more contrasty this whole,0.35,Positive,1
outer display thing it's trying to make,0.0,Neutral,0
it a more socially acceptable lifestyle,0.26666666666666666,Positive,1
product but it's also pretty clear that,0.17500000000000002,Positive,1
apple knows that that time isn't now and,0.0,Neutral,0
they know that the best thing this can,1.0,Positive,1
possibly be in its current form is just,0.0,Neutral,0
a high-end tech demo that excites the,0.0,Neutral,0
people that they need to excite but it,0.0,Neutral,0
does that pretty well one more thing,0.375,Positive,1
about the vision pro is that it has made,0.0,Neutral,0
me more so than ever glad that i have a,0.5,Positive,1
surf shark vpn subscription i've been,0.0,Neutral,0
using this in all sorts of places around,0.0,Neutral,0
the world connected to varying degrees,0.0,Neutral,0
of wi-fi trustworthiness and so knowing,0.0,Neutral,0
that i can have a consistent internet,0.25,Positive,1
experience that i can watch the tv shows,0.0,Neutral,0
that i want to watch that i can browse,0.0,Neutral,0
not just privately in this but also,0.0,Neutral,0
securely anywhere is a big deal and surf,0.2,Positive,1
shark in particular is much more than,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
just a vpn it can mock your gps location,0.0,Neutral,0
as well as your internet traffic so,0.0,Neutral,0
let's say you're playing pokémon go and,0.0,Neutral,0
you want to catch a pokémon in japan you,0.0,Neutral,0
can now do that from your bedroom and,0.0,Neutral,0
"save yourself about 11,000 in flights",0.0,Neutral,0
it has a kill switch which means if you,0.0,Neutral,0
want to make sure that you're secure at,0.45,Positive,1
all times you can set it up so that,0.0,Neutral,0
anytime your vpn connection drops it,0.0,Neutral,0
automatically cuts your internet,0.0,Neutral,0
connection and honestly like a thousand,0.6,Positive,1
more features finished off by the fact,0.5,Positive,1
that with the code boss it's less than,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
3 a month for an unlimited number of,0.0,Neutral,0
accounts with three extra months for,0.0,Neutral,0
free and a 30-day money back guarantee,0.2,Positive,1
everything that apple has ever done is,0.0,Neutral,0
all leading to this the apple vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
here it,0.0,Neutral,0
is spatial computing is the newest term,0.0,Neutral,0
that you'll hear be tossed around and,0.0,Neutral,0
until you actually experience the apple,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro in real life it might be hard,-0.04583333333333334,Negative,0
to grasp now i know it was for me until,0.0,Neutral,0
i put this headset on for the first time,0.25,Positive,1
and everything just clicked its ability,0.0,Neutral,0
to transport you into another world,0.0,Neutral,0
while staying inside of your comfy cozy,-0.19999999999999998,Negative,0
apple eco system is what really sets,0.2,Positive,1
this apart from other headsets of course,-0.125,Negative,0
the price does as well but this really,0.2,Positive,1
is unlike anything i've ever experienced,0.8,Positive,1
the entire headset is so nice and,0.3,Positive,1
everything feels like a high quality,0.16,Positive,1
apple product as you'd expect it's got,0.0,Neutral,0
this beautiful aluminum frame with a,0.85,Positive,1
digital crown and this button right on,0.14285714285714285,Positive,1
top it kind of looks like a stretched,0.35000000000000003,Positive,1
out apple watch if you really look at it,0.2,Positive,1
the front is made of a custom curved,0.0,Neutral,0
glass and under it is actually a display,0.0,Neutral,0
that will showcase to the outside world,0.0,Neutral,0
when you're watching content or a little,-0.1875,Negative,0
dis display a visual representation of,0.0,Neutral,0
the user's eyes when you're talking to,0.0,Neutral,0
someone now the inside is an ultra high,0.16,Positive,1
resolution display that has 23 million,0.0,Neutral,0
pixels across the two displays which is,0.0,Neutral,0
more than a 4k tv for each one of your,0.5,Positive,1
eyes the most impressive thing about it,0.75,Positive,1
though is the way that it just feels,0.0,Neutral,0
intuitive as soon as you put it on the,0.0,Neutral,0
natural way you just look at something,0.1,Positive,1
and you make a pinching gesture to,0.0,Neutral,0
select it and it just freaking works,0.0,Neutral,0
like it truly feels like you're,0.0,Neutral,0
witnessing a miracle now before we get,0.0,Neutral,0
more into this let's do my favorite,0.5,Positive,1
thing and unbox it,0.0,Neutral,0

dual band loop so this does come with,0.0,Neutral,0
two different bands depending upon which,0.0,Neutral,0
one fits your preference i kind of like,0.6,Positive,1
the do loop band because it seems to,0.0,Neutral,0
alleviate a lot of the pressure of the,0.0,Neutral,0
device here it is it's kind of just like,0.6,Positive,1
a big apple watch band but for your head,0.0,Neutral,0
we've got a usbc cable we've got the,0.0,Neutral,0
battery pack which is such a beautiful,0.425,Positive,1
battery pack like if apple made one of,0.0,Neutral,0
these just to like charge my phone i'd,0.0,Neutral,0
buy two think about it and this is a,0.0,Neutral,0
little connector that goes into the side,-0.1875,Negative,0
it isn't mag safe it is actually,0.25,Positive,1
mechanical so you do have to place it in,0.0,Neutral,0
and then turn it which is good because,0.7,Positive,1
this keeps it in place if it was mag,0.0,Neutral,0
safe you don't want this turning off mid,0.25,Positive,1
activity and we've got a charging,0.0,Neutral,0
brick what's in here we still have more,0.5,Positive,1
things a polishing cloth can you even,0.0,Neutral,0
believe it oh this is a nice so this is,0.6,Positive,1
a special vision pro polishing cloth,0.35714285714285715,Positive,1
it's a much thinner texture than the,0.2,Positive,1
polishing cloths that they have for your,0.0,Neutral,0
computer also smells new and fresh okay,0.3121212121212121,Positive,1
i haven't seen a sticker,0.0,Neutral,0
yet all right this is the extra light,0.22857142857142856,Positive,1
seal cushion that they give you there's,0.0,Neutral,0
one that's a little bit thicker so,-0.1875,Negative,0
depending upon the fit you can figure,0.4,Positive,1
out which one's right for,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
you so here's everything that comes in,0.0,Neutral,0
the apple vision pro box we've got our,0.0,Neutral,0

light seal the solo knit band and the du,0.4,Positive,1
band loop the other thing that we have,-0.125,Negative,0

optical lenses now this is something,0.0,Neutral,0
that you can order if you have,0.0,Neutral,0
prescription lenses you can get them if,0.0,Neutral,0
you're near size it or far sided now,0.1,Positive,1
these are just some readers as a demo to,0.0,Neutral,0
show you how to insert them they go in,0.0,Neutral,0
magnetically so if you do wear contacts,0.0,Neutral,0
you don't actually have to buy these so,0.0,Neutral,0
i'll show you how these,0.0,Neutral,0
work there they are so these will just,0.0,Neutral,0
pop right on like inserts to the vision,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
pro that's it and they're on that was,0.0,Neutral,0
easy now this is the vision pro case,0.43333333333333335,Positive,1
obviously it is sold separately it's a,0.0,Neutral,0
little wrinkled i think that's the style,-0.1875,Negative,0
that they're going for i'm kind of into,0.6,Positive,1
it it's a nice fresh white and up here,0.3,Positive,1
we've got the vision pro travel case tag,0.0,Neutral,0
let's open it and see what it looks like,0.0,Neutral,0
i like this nice little handle here that,0.20625,Positive,1
actually comes out a little bit so you,-0.09375,Negative,0
can carry it it's so squishy like,0.0,Neutral,0
actually this could be a nice travel,0.3,Positive,1
pillow like i 100% would use this on the,0.0,Neutral,0
plane like i would oh it's so soft and,0.1,Positive,1
so so,0.0,Neutral,0
nice look at that vision pro travel case,0.6,Positive,1
we've got some documentation okay so,0.5,Positive,1
this shows you how to put it in cuz i i,0.0,Neutral,0
was curious okay so that's where you,0.2,Positive,1
clip in the,0.0,Neutral,0
battery,0.0,Neutral,0
a little baggie oh it's a little,-0.1875,Negative,0
accessory,0.0,Neutral,0
pouch oh that's so nice now we put,0.6,Positive,1
vision pro in and this is cool it's got,0.35,Positive,1
like a little adjustable slider because,-0.1875,Negative,0
depending upon what size light seal and,0.4,Positive,1
cushion that you have you might need to,0.0,Neutral,0
adjust it so i do have the small so,-0.25,Negative,0
pushing that all the way forward and,0.0,Neutral,0
we've got this cute little bag to put,0.15625,Positive,1
all of our accessories in check this out,0.0,Neutral,0
look at this,0.0,Neutral,0
i see why this was so expensive because,-0.5,Negative,0
it is a really nice case i get,0.6,Positive,1
it and there we go apple vision pro is,0.0,Neutral,0
ready to go this does have a travel mode,0.2,Positive,1
so if you are on a plane a train or if,0.0,Neutral,0
you're the passenger of a car you can,0.0,Neutral,0
set that into travel mode so be able to,0.5,Positive,1
use this while you're moving i won't be,0.0,Neutral,0
testing that out here in this video but,0.0,Neutral,0
stay tuned for a future one where i take,0.0,Neutral,0
it on the go and see what it's like now,0.0,Neutral,0
the moment that we've all been waiting,0.0,Neutral,0
for let's set it,0.0,Neutral,0
up,0.0,Neutral,0
music,0.0,Neutral,0
all right just want to give you guys a,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
little look at the headset so obviously,-0.09375,Negative,0
we've got our little cover on here so,-0.1875,Negative,0
when we take it off we are greeted with,0.0,Neutral,0
this beautiful front display now this is,0.85,Positive,1
a modular system so if we don't want to,0.0,Neutral,0
have the solo knit loop we can just pop,0.0,Neutral,0
this right off we've got these little,0.04910714285714285,Positive,1
pull tabs right here can just pull pop,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
them off and then we can just put on the,0.0,Neutral,0
dual loop band so what's cool is is if,0.35,Positive,1
you do want to give someone guest access,0.0,Neutral,0
and they have a different size head you,0.0,Neutral,0
just need to order the different size,0.0,Neutral,0
light seal and the cushion and this will,0.4,Positive,1
allow you to just swap this out to give,0.0,Neutral,0
someone access to guest mode now this,0.0,Neutral,0
device can only be registered to one,0.0,Neutral,0
person so using optic id this will,0.0,Neutral,0
basically be sealed to you they will be,0.0,Neutral,0
able to go into guest mode so we'll test,0.5,Positive,1
that out later going to take off our,0.0,Neutral,0
little like it kind of looks like a bra,0.20625,Positive,1
like i'm just going to say it like it's,0.0,Neutral,0
it is what it is i'm so nervous like i,0.0,Neutral,0
feel i feel warm so you just line up the,0.6,Positive,1
little dots to the circle and then you,-0.1875,Negative,0
rotate and we are dialed in so you'll,0.0,Neutral,0
see there's a little light right there,0.16607142857142856,Positive,1
it's blinking now it's going to keep,0.0,Neutral,0
blinking and as soon as it turns solid,0.0,Neutral,0
then the headset is ready to be put on,0.2,Positive,1
there is an initial setup process that,0.0,Neutral,0
you have to go through you only have to,0.0,Neutral,0
do this once when you first get the,0.25,Positive,1
device and then it'll automatically be,0.0,Neutral,0
calibrated to you the coolest thing,0.0,Neutral,0
though is the way that this is able to,0.5,Positive,1
detect your eye,0.0,Neutral,0
tracking looks like we have a solid,0.0,Neutral,0
light it's time to go in i can't believe,0.4,Positive,1
this moment is here so the solo knit has,0.0,Neutral,0
a little tightener right back here so,0.03273809523809523,Positive,1
you just tighten that to get a nice snug,0.6,Positive,1
fit i'm going to press this to hold to,0.4,Positive,1
align my,0.0,Neutral,0
eyeballs oh my,0.0,Neutral,0
gosh it's happening wo there's an apple,0.0,Neutral,0
logo that just popped up i can see i can,0.0,Neutral,0
see everything i see you a little hello,-0.1875,Negative,0
has just written itself across my screen,0.0,Neutral,0
oh my gosh all right so now it's telling,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
me to bring my iphone ipad nearby to get,0.0,Neutral,0
started so let's set it up this is so,0.0,Neutral,0
i'm using my phone right now and and,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
it's like i am seeing with my real eyes,0.2,Positive,1
all right so this is the first time that,0.26785714285714285,Positive,1
you guys are seeing what i'm seeing the,0.0,Neutral,0
cool thing is basically on day one we're,0.35,Positive,1
going to have access to over a million,0.0,Neutral,0
apps because of the app store with all,0.0,Neutral,0
the iphone apps the ipad apps a lot of,0.0,Neutral,0
these are compatible with vision pro so,0.0,Neutral,0
it's super exciting that we will be able,0.37777777777777777,Positive,1
to use a lot of those apps seamlessly,0.1,Positive,1
right on the vision pro day one this is,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
what the vision pro app store looks,0.0,Neutral,0
like now the tech in this thing is what,0.0,Neutral,0
is really so impressive just the cameras,1.0,Positive,1
and the sensors alone and the way that,0.0,Neutral,0
they are able to duplicate such a real,0.2333333333333333,Positive,1
life experience with the pass through,0.0,Neutral,0
video there's two main cameras on the,0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
front two on the side two ir,0.0,Neutral,0
illuminators four four downward cameras,0.0,Neutral,0
two true depth cameras and a light r,0.375,Positive,1
scanner right in the front with all of,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
these this lets you casually have your,-0.5000000000000001,Negative,0
hands placed on your lap to the side or,0.0,Neutral,0
really almost anywhere and still be able,0.35,Positive,1
to pinch to select now doing a facetime,0.0,Neutral,0
in vision pro i will say is probably one,0.0,Neutral,0
of the wildest experiences oh my gosh,0.0,Neutral,0
okay we were just debating like what is,0.5,Positive,1
what's what's your hair stripe going to,0.0,Neutral,0
look like it kind of looks blended out,0.6,Positive,1
right it doesn't get the spikiness but,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
it's there yeah right yeah the faces are,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
impressive i think right very very it's,0.5152380952380952,Positive,1
it's just at the edge of uncanny valley,0.0,Neutral,0
like i know what you guys look like so i,0.0,Neutral,0
know that they look like you this is,0.0,Neutral,0
like like i mean i feel like this is,-0.3125,Negative,0
like a nine out of 10 like of how we,0.0,Neutral,0
actually look it's pretty good and also,0.31666666666666665,Positive,1
like skin tones too cuz we've all three,0.0,Neutral,0
of us have very different complexions,0.0,Neutral,0
too and i feel like it actually i think,0.0,Neutral,0
it did a pretty good job every single,0.29285714285714287,Positive,1
time i get on a facetime call with this,0.0,Neutral,0
it's the same reaction of whoa like this,0.0,Neutral,0
is weird and i realize i've gotten used,-0.5,Negative,0
to it and i think after a while everyone,0.0,Neutral,0
using this is just going to get used to,0.0,Neutral,0
it after you get over the initial holy,0.0,Neutral,0
crap look at this thing well thank you,-0.8,Negative,0
guys this was cool this is this is dope,0.35,Positive,1
this is dope thumbs thumbs i see i saw,0.0,Neutral,0
more of one of his okay bye,0.5,Positive,1
music,0.0,Neutral,0
y'all so now that i have everything all,0.0,Neutral,0
set up i want to take you through how to,0.0,Neutral,0
actually use vision pro this is the,0.0,Neutral,0
i don't want to say it's even,0.0,Neutral,0
challenging because it's super easy so,0.4222222222222222,Positive,1
if this is the most challenging part,0.5,Positive,1
then you're going to be set up for,0.0,Neutral,0
success after this because it's so,0.3,Positive,1
simple it's so intuitive and it really,0.1,Positive,1
is amazing how accurate the eye tracking,0.5000000000000001,Positive,1
is it's made me feel really strange now,-0.05,Negative,0
in the real world because when i'm,0.2,Positive,1
looking at something it's hard for my,-0.2916666666666667,Negative,0
brain to comprehend that i can't look at,0.0,Neutral,0
it pinch and bring it closer to myself,0.0,Neutral,0
oh apple vision pro side effects all,0.0,Neutral,0
right i'm going in okay i'm now inside,0.39285714285714285,Positive,1
and as you can see i can see everything,0.0,Neutral,0
that's happening here so we've got a,0.0,Neutral,0
little studio light here got you right,0.16607142857142856,Positive,1
there on my camera hello got armand over,0.0,Neutral,0
there hello and it doesn't feel like,0.0,Neutral,0
i've left my living room like i am still,0.0,Neutral,0
in it now the interesting thing is it's,0.5,Positive,1
so realistic but also it does have that,0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
slight feel that you're looking at a,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
screen so it is kind of confusing to,0.15,Positive,1
your brain but for the most part i feel,0.5,Positive,1
like i'm looking around and things just,0.0,Neutral,0
start popping up and it's so,0.0,Neutral,0
unbelievable that i it's hard for me to,-0.27083333333333337,Negative,0
even articulate but let's just go,0.0,Neutral,0
through and let me show you some things,0.0,Neutral,0
on how this works so this is the digital,0.0,Neutral,0
crown and when i press that that brings,0.0,Neutral,0
up our main menu here when i want to go,0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
and open something i literally just look,0.0,Neutral,0
at it so as you see each icon kind of,0.6,Positive,1
getting a little bit highlighted and a,-0.1875,Negative,0
little bit bigger now you just use the,-0.09375,Negative,0
pinch,0.0,Neutral,0
gesture to pinch and select things and,0.0,Neutral,0
i'm using it to slide through the menu,0.0,Neutral,0

your face oh my gosh you can even see my,0.0,Neutral,0
hands like this is wild and you go,0.1,Positive,1
through this process where you scan your,0.0,Neutral,0
hands front and back and then you hold,0.0,Neutral,0
the vision pro in front of your face so,0.0,Neutral,0
you take it off of your head hold it in,0.0,Neutral,0

up down you smile without your teeth you,0.0722222222222222,Positive,1
smile with your teeth and then you raise,0.3,Positive,1
your eyebrows and then you close your,0.0,Neutral,0
eyes and that is all it takes to create,0.0,Neutral,0
your persona and this is in beta so it,0.0,Neutral,0
is all still a work in progress but,0.0,Neutral,0
you'll actually see that it gets all of,0.0,Neutral,0
the details i wish i would have fixed my,0.1,Positive,1

immersed i can dial this,0.0,Neutral,0
back and you'll see that it goes away as,0.0,Neutral,0
you,0.0,Neutral,0
dial in the transparency so the headset,0.0,Neutral,0
lets people know if you're actually,0.0,Neutral,0
looking at them or if you're looking at,0.0,Neutral,0
content so obviously i am watching some,0.0,Neutral,0
content right now now if anybody else is,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1

around and i think as i use this more,0.5,Positive,1
i'll get used to it more where right now,0.39285714285714285,Positive,1
i think i'm like actively looking at,-0.13333333333333333,Negative,0
something because i know that's how i,0.0,Neutral,0
select whereas i feel it becoming more,0.475,Positive,1
second nature and it'll be less i feel,-0.08333333333333333,Negative,0

music,0.0,Neutral,0
wild well thank you guys for watching i,0.1,Positive,1
know this is a long video but i was,-0.05,Negative,0
trying to be as thorough as possible in,0.0,Neutral,0
giving you guys the unboxing experience,0.0,Neutral,0
and what it's like to actually use it,0.0,Neutral,0
the only problem is a lot of the footage,0.0,Neutral,0
that i'm showing you like it doesn't,0.0,Neutral,0
look as good as it does in the headset,0.7,Positive,1
stuff that i'm showing you it looks,0.0,Neutral,0
perfectly fine on screen but when it's,0.4166666666666667,Positive,1
actually inside of this headset and in,0.0,Neutral,0
your head it just looks so crystal clear,0.10000000000000002,Positive,1
and everything is just so real life that,0.2,Positive,1
i cannot just enough how you got to try,0.0,Neutral,0
it like if you're not going to buy one i,0.0,Neutral,0
don't that's fine find a friend hop in,0.4166666666666667,Positive,1
guest mode test it out go to the apple,0.0,Neutral,0
store and just use it because it needs,0.0,Neutral,0
to be something that you experience just,0.0,Neutral,0
so that you're getting your mind wrapped,0.0,Neutral,0
around what the possible future looks,0.0,Neutral,0
like for spatial computing not only for,0.0,Neutral,0
apple but there's so many other headsets,0.1875,Positive,1
that i feel like are going to be kind of,0.6,Positive,1
going in this direction so not only for,0.0,Neutral,0
content creation shooting spatial video,0.0,Neutral,0
for advertisers for marketers like this,0.0,Neutral,0
is a whole new world and it's here so,0.16818181818181818,Positive,1
buckle up,0.0,Neutral,0
the apple vision pro.,0.0,Neutral,0
"not going to lie, when this was first announced,",0.25,Positive,1
i thought apple had lost their collective minds and,0.0,Neutral,0
"that this
headset was going to be the biggest flop in the history of tech.",0.0,Neutral,0
but then i tried it.,0.0,Neutral,0
"and as
a diehard android user and a pc consumer,",0.0,Neutral,0
the apple vision pro rocked my socks.,0.0,Neutral,0
"i used it for a total of about 2 hours,",0.0,Neutral,0
"knowing that eventually the time would come to,
you know, do what i do.",0.0,Neutral,0
"and i'll leave this software reviewing to the likes of ijustine or mkbhd,",0.0,Neutral,0
"i'm just here to talk about the build quality, hardware, and durability.",0.0,Neutral,0
"i will say, however, that
the first time i stood up while wearing it,",0.25,Positive,1
"i subconsciously ducked to avoid hitting
one of the virtual displays hanging in front of me.",0.0,Neutral,0
"and if that's not an indicator of how real this thing almost feels,",0.2,Positive,1
i'm not sure what is.,-0.25,Negative,0
"right out of the box, the apple vision pro comes
with a protective sock for the supposedly glass lens on the front.",0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
"there's a magnetically detachable light shield,
and i'm going to be honest again,",0.5,Positive,1
"the best piece of construction
on this vision pro is the solo-knit headband strap.",1.0,Positive,1
"apple says this thing is made from 70% recycled yarn,
but holy smokes if this thing isn't the softest,",-0.1,Negative,0
"most cuddliest piece
of fabric i've ever felt in my whole life.",0.35,Positive,1
"feels like it's been knitted
with the love of a thousand grandmas.",0.5,Positive,1
"there's a little snowboard binding style tightener on the side,",-0.1875,Negative,0
which fits the vibe since these already look like snowboarding goggles.,0.0,Neutral,0
"the solo-knit band is detachable
with a tiny orange pull tab and",0.0,Neutral,0
seems sturdy enough all by itself.,0.0,Neutral,0
"there are cameras splattered all over the front, inside,",0.0,Neutral,0
and on the bottom of the vision pro with very large fan vents built into the frame to cool down the internal hardware.,0.11825396825396825,Positive,1
"after all, the apple vision pro boils down to being just a computer for your face.",-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
"we'll see all of
its hardware glory in just a few seconds.",-0.2,Negative,0
"the proprietary
twist lock power cable is fine.",0.4166666666666667,Positive,1
there's no way a usb-c or,0.0,Neutral,0
"lightning cable would have been able to handle
a moving user like this thing is able to.",0.5,Positive,1
"and i have plenty more thoughts on the battery, but
we'll also get to that in just a second.",0.25,Positive,1
let's commence with the scratch test.,0.0,Neutral,0
"now this thing is a whopping 3,500
and it feels solid and good in the hand.",0.35,Positive,1
"i fully expected this front surface to be made from glass,",-0.1,Negative,0
especially after watching some other reviewers.,-0.0625,Negative,0
"but as we work our way up the mohs scale of hardness,",0.0,Neutral,0
"we start seeing scratches at a
level 3 with deeper grooves at a level 4.",0.0,Neutral,0
i was so shocked i had to go back and check again.,-0.35,Negative,0
"level 2 seems to be unaffected, but wow.",0.025,Positive,1
"i first thought to myself, don't worry jerry, you just
got bamboozled by a screen protector.",0.25,Positive,1
but there is no screen protector.,0.0,Neutral,0
"this scratched plastic
is permanently attached to the unit.",0.0,Neutral,0
"apple's calling this laminated glass on their website,",0.0,Neutral,0
"but when i read that i thought the laminate would be in the middle or underside, like on a windshield,",0.0,Neutral,0
not on top where it can get permanently scuffed up.,0.5,Positive,1
"any keys, coins, or metal
object that comes in contact with the",0.0,Neutral,0
"apple vision pro will leave a permanent,
unrepairable mark.",0.0,Neutral,0
"yeah, apple does sell applecare for 500, but even with that applecare,",0.0,Neutral,0
the cover glass replacements – the word glass is doing a lot of heavy lifting here – cost 300 additional.,-0.2,Negative,0
"that's a total of 800 to replace the front glass,",0.0,Neutral,0
"which is also conveniently
what the cracked cover glass replacements",0.0,Neutral,0
would have cost if you didn't buy applecare at all.,0.0,Neutral,0
i'm not super good at math.,0.26666666666666666,Positive,1
someone can double check my work there.,0.0,Neutral,0
"but applecare doesn't
seem like all that great of a deal on the apple vision pro.",0.8,Positive,1
"now don't get me wrong, being laminated is absolutely phenomenal when it comes to drops.",0.0,Neutral,0
"the glass is far less
likely to shatter with the laminate being  on the outside.",-0.016666666666666663,Negative,0
"plastic will absorb most
impacts without the glass shattering.",0.5,Positive,1
"but plastic on
the outside means it will scratch easier.",0.0,Neutral,0
"and if those scratches appear on top of one of the mini cameras or sensors around the outside,",0.25,Positive,1
"it's going to really mess up your world view, literally,
figuratively, and economically.",0.0625,Positive,1
the sock that comes with the vision pro best to be on at all times.,1.0,Positive,1
or apple needs to start selling an easily replaceable screen protector.,0.43333333333333335,Positive,1
"also, i would
highly recommend against smoking anything",0.16,Positive,1
"or standing near a campfire while wearing
the vision pro for obvious reasons.",0.05,Positive,1
"the silver anodized metal body of the apple vision pro
is milled from one solid piece of aluminum.",0.0,Neutral,0
extremely impressive actually.,0.5,Positive,1
"the deeper my own
team gets into manufacturing wheelchairs,",0.6,Positive,1
"the more i appreciate what
other companies are able to accomplish.",0.2916666666666667,Positive,1
and this apple vision pro body is truly a work of art.,0.0,Neutral,0
the lower cameras are covered with glass.,0.0,Neutral,0
"the front facing units are obviously covered with soft scratchable plastic,",0.05,Positive,1
so definitely keep an eye out for that.,0.0,Neutral,0
"the buttons
of course are also made from metal.",0.0,Neutral,0
"and continuing onward with the scratchable theme,",0.0,Neutral,0
"scratches on the exterior might not affect the viewing experience,",0.0,Neutral,0
"but scratches
on the interior most definitely will.",0.25,Positive,1
i cannot stress how important it is to not clean or,0.10833333333333334,Positive,1
"wipe the interior plastic lenses of the apple vision pro with paper towels, tissues, or napkins,",0.0,Neutral,0
since all of these paper products have wood fibers that will completely and,0.1,Positive,1
permanently absolutely wreck the plastic lenses.,0.2,Positive,1
"i wore glasses for about a decade, so i know firsthand.",0.0,Neutral,0
you should only use soft cloths to clean the inner lenses since,0.11666666666666667,Positive,1
they can scratch very easily.,0.5633333333333334,Positive,1
"the rubbery flexible ear speakers are pretty nifty,",0.25,Positive,1
"quite enough to fire directly down into your ears,",-0.07777777777777779,Negative,0
but loud enough to also be heard by nearby neighbors.,0.05,Positive,1
"the housing is made from metal,
but seems durable enough so far.",0.05,Positive,1
"the interior of the apple vision
pro with its lightsill removed is kind of a fluffy, stretchy,",0.19999999999999998,Positive,1
"black cloth thing with
a slightly translucent rubber underliner.",-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
"the rubber is probably there to help keep moisture,
makeup, sweat, and",0.0,Neutral,0
"tears of loneliness from entering into the motorized internals,
which we'll see more of in just a second.",0.25,Positive,1
"there are no visible screws on the outside,
which is fine.",0.20833333333333334,Positive,1
"personally i kind of like the industrial look of visible screws like on the apple watch ultra,",0.6,Positive,1
but i'm also totally fine with finding them on my own.,0.5083333333333333,Positive,1
"i was really good
at those where's waldo books as a kid.",0.7,Positive,1
"and yeah, it did look a little
bit better with the cloth in place.",0.15625,Positive,1
"even with it gone,",0.0,Neutral,0
we still don't see any screws.,0.0,Neutral,0
"so quick little bend
test to see if that might be the quickest way inside.",0.07291666666666666,Positive,1
"but the sheer girth of the
aluminum frame makes any flex impossible.",-0.3333333333333333,Negative,0
"there's no movement
when bent from the front or the back.",0.0,Neutral,0
thumbs up for that.,0.0,Neutral,0
so it looks like we have to actually find those screws if we want to see what's powering this thing and,0.0,Neutral,0
"what the internal and external
displays look like from the inside.",0.0,Neutral,0
"i thought that maybe i could heat up the exterior laminated glass and pop it off that way,",0.0,Neutral,0
but my first attempt only damaged the laminate more.,0.25,Positive,1
"instead i found that
there is a removable black plastic shield",-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
on the inside hiding some of the inner workings with a lot of t5 and t4 screws in really weird places.,-0.25,Negative,0
"this comes as a shock to no one,",0.0,Neutral,0
"but the apple
vision pro is not designed to be repaired.",0.0,Neutral,0
"with a plethora of screws removed,",0.0,Neutral,0
"the lens mechanism can lift up and away from the frame to reveal dual turbo fans,",0.0,Neutral,0
"very similar
to what we see inside of a macbook.",0.0,Neutral,0
"and this thing does
look incredibly awesome from the inside.",1.0,Positive,1
"the lenses can automatically motorize left and right,",0.14285714285714285,Positive,1
"measuring interpupillary distances between
51 millimeters all the way to 75 millimeters.",0.0,Neutral,0
"the near instant
functionality of this thing is exquisite.",0.3666666666666667,Positive,1
"i do have some thoughts on accessibility improvements, but we'll get to that later.",0.0,Neutral,0
every screw in here is different and,0.0,Neutral,0
there are about 4 or 5 different types of screws.,0.0,Neutral,0
repairability is again an afterthought.,0.0,Neutral,0
"with the plastic lenses gone, we can
dig even deeper to find the inner screen.",0.0,Neutral,0
"apple says there are 23 million pixels inside the vision pro, micro oled pixels to be exact,",0.25,Positive,1
"all of which are jam-packed into two rectangles,
one for each eye.",0.0,Neutral,0
these rectangles are about 32 millimeters wide and 27 millimeters tall.,-0.1,Negative,0
don't let its small size fool you though.,-0.25,Negative,0
"the experience of visiting the moon in these things is otherworldly,",0.0,Neutral,0
and i really am a fan of the vision pro.,0.2,Positive,1
"not enough to actually go back to an iphone,",0.0,Neutral,0
"not at least until they have scheduled text messages, but i am still a fan.",-0.3,Negative,0
"and speaking of fans, again,",0.0,Neutral,0
"we find ourselves with no more visible screws from this side of the vision pro,",-0.25,Negative,0
not even under the carbon fiber looking structure in the middle.,0.0,Neutral,0
"apple's making this teardown difficult,
but that's okay.",0.0,Neutral,0
i enjoy a challenge.,0.4,Positive,1
"and it'll give us another
opportunity to enter in from the screen.",0.0,Neutral,0
"especially now that i know this is the only way left to get inside,",0.0,Neutral,0
i can be a bit more aggressive.,0.5,Positive,1
"we still need to find the
outer screen and the processing hardware.",0.0,Neutral,0
"and finally, with some heat and some razor accurate penetration, thanks to my jerry-rig knife,",0.20000000000000004,Positive,1
"i'm able to slice around the exterior of the apple vision pro and
remove that top laminated glass layer.",0.5,Positive,1
"hard to believe that apple charges 800 for this procedure
when my razor knife only costs 15.",-0.14583333333333334,Negative,0
but alright.,0.0,Neutral,0
there you have it.,0.0,Neutral,0
the apple vision pro's 3 dimensionally formed laminated cover glass removed in one piece.,0.0,Neutral,0
wild that this piece of glass alone costs more than some iphones.,0.3,Positive,1
a question i get quite a lot is why i don't continue my mohs hardness scratch test all the way up to level 9.,0.0,Neutral,0
"well, let me show you.",0.0,Neutral,0
the grand canyon level grooves left by a level 9 pick compromise the glass enough to shatter it out of existence.,0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
but at least now we know that there really is glass underneath all that plastic.,-0.04999999999999999,Negative,0
"screws still somehow manage to elude us,",0.0,Neutral,0
"but don't worry, my patience is immeasurable.",0.0,Neutral,0
"turns out there is another black
plastic layer on this side containing",-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
"some sort of filter for
the robocop style front display screen.",0.0,Neutral,0
"turns out the reason why this screen is displaying people's eyes
so uniquely is because it's a lenticular lens,",0.375,Positive,1
"a ribbed display which produces the
illusion of depth by having a holographic effect.",0.0,Neutral,0
"it definitely produces a memorable visual animation,
that's for sure.",0.25,Positive,1
"and it's under this lenticular
display that we finally see the hardware.",0.0,Neutral,0
"buckled down with a smorgasbord of screws and ribbon cables,",-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
the front facing camera array comes off as one complete unit.,0.1,Positive,1
"not surprising since so many of the cameras and
lidar sensors have to be perfectly positioned",0.3833333333333333,Positive,1
"so they can
all work in unison with that new r1 chip.",0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
"and i learned the hard way,",-0.2916666666666667,Negative,0
"there is a copious amount of
thermal paste on apple's circuit boards.",0.0,Neutral,0
"joined together by a flexible hinge over the nose, there are dual boards,",0.0,Neutral,0
one in front of each eye.,0.0,Neutral,0
"and they both use a metal plate directly attached to the
backside of the turbo fans for cooling.",0.1,Positive,1
"with the thermal paste removed, we see the glorious
m2 chip and the phenomenal r1 chip.",0.5,Positive,1
"the r1 chip is what takes all the inputs from the cameras, microphones, sensors, and",0.0,Neutral,0
"within 12 milliseconds creates a nearly lag free real time view
of the world around you inside the mask.",0.2333333333333333,Positive,1
"since as we have clearly seen,
the vision pro itself is not transparent.",0.10000000000000002,Positive,1
the world is digitally recreated for the viewer inside of the headset on the screens that we ripped out earlier.,0.0,Neutral,0
"i feel like the vision pro is the first
generation of something really special.",0.3035714285714286,Positive,1
"it does feel weird to say,",-0.5,Negative,0
but seeing apple branch out for the first time in a decade and try something new is really exciting.,0.22878787878787876,Positive,1
"i do wish apple could make it slightly more accessible though to 
people with physical impairments.",0.2916666666666667,Positive,1
"maybe instead of making the click a fingertip tap,",0.0,Neutral,0
"for people without finger function there could be an option for a wrist twist, which could be the click,",0.0,Neutral,0
"or a double blink which would make the
vision pro more usable for high spinal cord injuries.",0.22,Positive,1
"accessibility is pretty important, and
the vision pro is nearly there already.",0.25,Positive,1
"the whole vision pro contraption of course is
powered by a rather small external battery pack.",-0.016666666666666663,Negative,0
"and at first glance, the 3,166 milliamp
hour capacity seems rather small.",0.0,Neutral,0
"but the real number to look at though is the watt hour,",0.2,Positive,1
"since the voltage of this battery pack is far higher than the
voltage of a normal cell phone battery.",0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
"the 35.9 watt hours of this battery
bank should last for about 2 hours.",0.0,Neutral,0

"enter
my channel sponsor, anker.",0.0,Neutral,0
"with their anker maggo 10,000 milliamp hour power bank can almost double the run time of the apple vision pro,",0.0,Neutral,0
"or almost completely charge up an iphone 15 pro twice,",0.1,Positive,1

get our hands on it and obviously as,0.0,Neutral,0
you're aware we're talking about a,0.25,Positive,1
fairly expensive device and then trying,-0.5,Negative,0
to import it and stuff you spend a few,-0.2,Negative,0
more bucks i'm conflicted about this,0.5,Positive,1
device in general i mean before even,-0.13124999999999998,Negative,0
trying it just the concept of it i do,0.0,Neutral,0
want to kick it off with the hardware,0.0,Neutral,0
itself though before getting into sort,0.0,Neutral,0
of the bigger picture about what this,0.0,Neutral,0
all means the future of humanity inside,0.0,Neutral,0
of headsets eventually could be an issue,0.0,Neutral,0
for some of us or all of us anyways,0.0,Neutral,0
we're we're definitely not there yet so,0.0,Neutral,0
it's not a massive concern at the moment,0.0,Neutral,0
but this certainly does seem like an,0.21428571428571427,Positive,1
indication of the future and you don't,0.0,Neutral,0
have to play with it for very long in,-0.065,Negative,0
order to see why and how that will,0.0,Neutral,0
probably be the case but first let's,0.25,Positive,1
talk about the hardware because there,0.0,Neutral,0
are other companies making headsets and,-0.125,Negative,0
we will be inside of headsets at some,0.0,Neutral,0
point in the future for some period of,0.0,Neutral,0
time throughout the day apple is not the,0.0,Neutral,0
first to the party and and that's not,0.25,Positive,1
unusual for them apple has historically,0.1,Positive,1
waited before entering a particular,0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
segment devices like the quest which,0.0,Neutral,0
this one's now in its third generation,0.0,Neutral,0
so obviously there's been some learning,0.0,Neutral,0
that's happened there there's a very,0.2,Positive,1
specific and seemingly different,0.0,Neutral,0
approach that meta has taken to the,0.0,Neutral,0
headset with the emphasis on gaming with,0.0,Neutral,0
that oculus origin apple on the other,-0.125,Negative,0
hand it's harder to pinpoint who their,-0.1,Negative,0
target is and what they hope for this,0.0,Neutral,0
thing to do best the hardware unique to,0.6875,Positive,1
this space you can't even pinpoint your,0.0,Neutral,0
typical plastic like this plastic that,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
mainly makes up the quest you can't find,0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
it on here you have this soft touch,0.1,Positive,1
material on these arms that support the,0.0,Neutral,0
back strap and also the speakers but,0.0,Neutral,0
after that you are talking about fabric,0.0,Neutral,0
and metal and glass and a seemingly,0.0,Neutral,0
organic type of design it feels and,0.0,Neutral,0
looks futuristic they include another,0.0,Neutral,0
headband which is a little bit more,0.15625,Positive,1
traditional it's going to take some of,0.0,Neutral,0
the weight and put it on the top of your,0.5,Positive,1
head which allows you to have the,0.0,Neutral,0
headset less tight to your face could be,-0.17261904761904762,Negative,0
more comfortable for some this unit has,0.45,Positive,1
these wires that travel through it and,0.0,Neutral,0
this knob allows you to quickly tighten,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
it and loosen it this to me is more,0.5,Positive,1
interesting the comfort is okay for my,0.5,Positive,1
face and head shape but that's a limited,-0.07142857142857142,Negative,0
usage i've used it mostly here in the,0.5,Positive,1
studio seated little bit of work on the,-0.1875,Negative,0
couch watching movies and things like,0.0,Neutral,0
that and and maybe if you're trying to,0.0,Neutral,0
do more activity with this you might,0.5,Positive,1
want the added security of the head,0.0,Neutral,0
strap now the way that these straps,0.0,Neutral,0
attach and detach is right here with,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
these orange tabs and i don't mind the,0.0,Neutral,0
way that connect connection takes place,0.0,Neutral,0
you hear the sound to know that it's,0.4,Positive,1
clipped properly and it's sort of guided,0.0,Neutral,0
into place it's an easy target however,0.43333333333333335,Positive,1
speaking of connection points this,0.0,Neutral,0
section around the eyes is a little bit,-0.1875,Negative,0
more precarious i like the fact that,0.5,Positive,1
it's easy to remove your different,0.21666666666666667,Positive,1
elements for cleaning you got to start,0.0,Neutral,0
thinking about hygiene with these things,0.0,Neutral,0
living so close to your face and head,0.0,Neutral,0
however this is a section that you,0.0,Neutral,0
commonly grab to pick up other headsets,-0.2125,Negative,0
and as you can see here you would not,0.0,Neutral,0
want to do that with this headset here,0.0,Neutral,0
if i grip there there was a moment where,0.0,Neutral,0
you almost dropped it on the ground,0.0,Neutral,0
because you just instinctive see there,0.0,Neutral,0
you go instinctively picked it up where,0.0,Neutral,0
the eye cushion was and it's not just,0.0,Neutral,0
this piece there's a bit stronger magnet,0.0,Neutral,0
on the shield here but it's all magnets,0.0,Neutral,0
so i like the fact that it's magnets and,0.0,Neutral,0
easy removal for cleaning but then you,0.43333333333333335,Positive,1
have to be aware of how you pick it up,0.25,Positive,1
versus on a traditional headset,0.0,Neutral,0
something like this it's i mean it comes,-0.3125,Negative,0
off but it's a little bit harder to get,-0.14375,Negative,0
it off you can easily pick it up from,0.43333333333333335,Positive,1
that location they also include this,0.0,Neutral,0
fabric textured cover for the exterior,0.0,Neutral,0
in order to both protect for travel,0.0,Neutral,0
another point on the hardware it does,0.0,Neutral,0
come with two different face cushions,0.0,Neutral,0
this one's called w+ and this one just w,0.0,Neutral,0
obviously the plus is giving you more,0.25,Positive,1
cushion which therefore gives you a,0.0,Neutral,0
slightly better seal from your,0.5,Positive,1
environment a darker experience when you,0.0,Neutral,0
want to have the lights turned down,-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
inside and then as far as blocking the,0.1,Positive,1
real world or shifting from augmented,0.2,Positive,1
into virtual this little dial here will,-0.1875,Negative,0
help you control that that's a familiar,0.375,Positive,1
dial because apple has utilized things,0.0,Neutral,0
like this on other devices including the,-0.125,Negative,0
apple watch so that will give you some,0.0,Neutral,0
comfort if you're already used to apple,0.0,Neutral,0
devices it'll also control your volume,0.0,Neutral,0
which speed speaking of volume that,0.0,Neutral,0
brings me to the sound will absolutely,0.30000000000000004,Positive,1
surprise you of course these are not,0.0,Neutral,0
headphones they're not sitting in your,0.0,Neutral,0
ear or over your ear they're just near,0.1,Positive,1
your ear but when you include apple,0.0,Neutral,0
spatial technology you get an incredibly,0.9,Positive,1
immersive experience but there is one,0.0,Neutral,0
problem with that there's a lot of sound,0.4,Positive,1
bleed so much so that will was like hey,0.2,Positive,1
man turn it down which would obviously,-0.07777777777777779,Negative,0
be a problem in any kind of quiet,0.3,Positive,1
environment including an airplane you,0.0,Neutral,0
can use your airpods i mean you can use,-0.3125,Negative,0
wireless headphones and then not have to,0.0,Neutral,0
worry about that but if you want those,0.0,Neutral,0
spatial functions then you're going to,0.0,Neutral,0
need to be using some airpods but as it,0.0,Neutral,0
stands not having anything in your ears,0.0,Neutral,0
i promise you will be surprised by the,0.1,Positive,1
sound performance of these little,0.10625000000000001,Positive,1
speakers the other thing you're going to,-0.125,Negative,0
be impressed by is just the visual,0.5,Positive,1
performance in general as soon as you,0.05000000000000002,Positive,1
open up a movie or look at one of the,0.0,Neutral,0
scenic areas or just i mean even just,-0.3125,Negative,0
look at the text there is tons of,0.0,Neutral,0
resolution to work with it's the best,1.0,Positive,1
looking headset that i've put on from,0.0,Neutral,0
that perspective this for me is kind of,0.6,Positive,1
like headphones for your eyes and here's,0.0,Neutral,0
what i mean by that the vast majority of,-0.15625,Negative,0
things that i feel like i can do or want,0.0,Neutral,0
to do inside of this headset are,0.0,Neutral,0
consumption based watching things you'll,0.0,Neutral,0
be amazed even though there's no youtube,0.0,Neutral,0
app the youtube safari interface on,0.0,Neutral,0
shorts you can easily just roll the dice,0.43333333333333335,Positive,1
and slot machine your content as you,0.0,Neutral,0
consume it but when you open up apple tv,0.0,Neutral,0
plus and you open up a movie and you,0.0,Neutral,0
scale that display and you either,0.0,Neutral,0
superimpose it in in augmented reality,0.0,Neutral,0
form or you head out into the desert in,0.0,Neutral,0
one of those scenic scenarios you have a,0.0,Neutral,0
beautiful experience you have an,0.85,Positive,1
experience that you really can't have,0.2,Positive,1
without having a large scale display and,0.21428571428571427,Positive,1
your premises may not allow for that and,0.0,Neutral,0
certainly if you're sitting on an,0.21428571428571427,Positive,1
airplane that also wouldn't be an option,0.0,Neutral,0
so what headphones have done for audio,0.0,Neutral,0
privacy the potential exists for the,0.0,Neutral,0
headset to do for video privacy for,0.0,Neutral,0
content consumption and enjoyment now,0.0,Neutral,0
the quest takes it a step further in so,0.0,Neutral,0
many other headsets in putting a focus,0.1875,Positive,1
on gaming and i'm not really sure what,-0.25,Negative,0
apple's play is on that i told will when,0.0,Neutral,0
i first started experimenting with the,0.25,Positive,1
headset hey apple should have done some,0.0,Neutral,0
sort of tech demo in order to highlight,0.0,Neutral,0
some of the hardware functionality and,0.0,Neutral,0
features and basically allow for you to,0.0,Neutral,0
learn the ui in a fun way and also,0.3,Positive,1
showcase to developers different ideas,0.0,Neutral,0
for how this hardware is complete,0.1,Positive,1
overkill the processor in here is way,0.0,Neutral,0
faster than it needs to be at the moment,0.0,Neutral,0
although it does need to push all those,0.0,Neutral,0
pixels now the closest thing that they,0.0,Neutral,0
have is this immersive memory thing,0.0,Neutral,0
where if you shoot spatial video then,0.0,Neutral,0
you can experience those memories again,0.0,Neutral,0
in such a way that you feel like you're,0.0,Neutral,0
inside of the them you can kind of look,0.6,Positive,1
around with them it got me to thinking,0.0,Neutral,0
that there's some futuristic content,0.0,Neutral,0
opportunities for developers and,0.0,Neutral,0
filmmakers and studios to be able to tap,0.5,Positive,1
into that three-dimensionality to put us,0.0,Neutral,0
in similar places inside of films but it,0.0,Neutral,0
is true it's extremely immersive now,0.11249999999999999,Positive,1
that immersion i mean depending on how,-0.3125,Negative,0
you look at it could be a little bit,-0.1875,Negative,0
creepy some people get scared thinking,-0.5,Negative,0
about those their memories in in in such,0.0,Neutral,0
a vivid and real kind of way but that's,0.5125,Positive,1
the demonstration that's in the headset,0.0,Neutral,0
right now that feels the most futuristic,0.39285714285714285,Positive,1
to me now let's talk a little bit about,-0.1875,Negative,0
this battery pack and all the brains,0.0,Neutral,0
that are housed over here it's connected,0.0,Neutral,0
via this cable proprietary cable which,0.0,Neutral,0
is kind of looks like a larger lightning,0.3,Positive,1
connector in order to extract it you,0.0,Neutral,0
need to use a sim tool and then out of,0.0,Neutral,0
there comes this braided connection now,0.0,Neutral,0
i was hoping this was some sort of a,0.0,Neutral,0
magnet but it's more serious than that,0.08333333333333334,Positive,1
this one clicks in and twists like so,0.0,Neutral,0
providing power to the head set now one,0.0,Neutral,0
of my gripes this thing charges or how,0.0,Neutral,0
it lets you know whether it's charging,0.0,Neutral,0
or not will and i don't have a,0.0,Neutral,0
tremendous amount of confidence we came,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
in the other morning and it was 0%,-0.125,Negative,0
battery i'm not sure i i went on reddit,-0.25,Negative,0
and saw a few other people were having,-0.1625,Negative,0
some issues with things charging it,0.0,Neutral,0
could be growing pains some people have,0.0,Neutral,0
to extract the cable reinsert it wiggle,0.0,Neutral,0
it push it i don't know it it might not,0.0,Neutral,0
be anything wrong it might just be the,-0.5,Negative,0
way that this is relaying information,0.0,Neutral,0
the other thing is you don't have a,-0.125,Negative,0
clear representation of overall battery,0.05000000000000001,Positive,1
life you have to jump into the headset,0.0,Neutral,0
at which point you then have to toggle a,0.0,Neutral,0
menu looking at the battery life and,0.0,Neutral,0
whether or not it's charging in there,0.0,Neutral,0
it's just a little bit like if this,-0.1875,Negative,0
thing had a display on it just showed,0.0,Neutral,0
you how much battery there was even if,0.2,Positive,1
it was a meter that would be kind of,0.6,Positive,1
cool now if you're wondering about,0.35,Positive,1
battery life and it's kind of a funny,0.425,Positive,1
one cuz you've got this external battery,0.0,Neutral,0
the headset's pretty heavy but then,0.024999999999999994,Positive,1
you're powering such incredible hardware,0.45,Positive,1
you've got these these high resolution,0.16,Positive,1
displays so you're pushing all those,0.0,Neutral,0
pixels you're going to get between two,0.0,Neutral,0
like maybe two 2 and 1/2 hours of,0.0,Neutral,0
battery life on here one nice thing,0.6,Positive,1
because you've got this usbc connection,0.0,Neutral,0
point now you can go ahead and throw a,0.0,Neutral,0
power brake into here and stay,0.0,Neutral,0
completely mobile while recharging the,0.1,Positive,1
internal battery in here so i'm just,0.0,Neutral,0
checking out this little battery unit,-0.1875,Negative,0
here it seems to state,0.0,Neutral,0
3166 milliamp hours now the nice thing,0.6,Positive,1
is that apple gave you usbc so if you're,0.0,Neutral,0
not happy with the battery life that,-0.4,Negative,0
you're getting on the unit you can reach,0.0,Neutral,0
for an external power bank like one from,0.0,Neutral,0
our partners over at ankor and extend,0.0,Neutral,0
your battery life and they just came out,0.0,Neutral,0
with a bunch of new products this is the,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
new mag go wireless charging station,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
which will actually charge all of your,0.0,Neutral,0
apple devices including having usb,0.0,Neutral,0
output that's how big it is look at this,0.0,Neutral,0
little thing so we're charging apple,-0.1875,Negative,0
watch airpod ods and then iphone all at,0.0,Neutral,0
once but just keep in mind this one does,0.0,Neutral,0
not include a power bank so the mago,0.0,Neutral,0
wireless charging 3 in one is comparable,0.0,Neutral,0
to an iphone 15 plus in weight and as,0.0,Neutral,0
compact as an apple magic mouse and,0.5,Positive,1
we've got this power bank it's the 10k,0.0,Neutral,0
mag go power bank it is fully compatible,0.0,Neutral,0
with apple's original mag save and it's,0.375,Positive,1
as fast as apple's own mag safe charger,0.43333333333333335,Positive,1
this one also adds a kickstand look how,0.0,Neutral,0
"clean that is you've got your 10,000",0.3666666666666667,Positive,1
mamp power battery powering your battery,0.0,Neutral,0
that powers your vision pro so you're,0.0,Neutral,0
extending your battery life,0.0,Neutral,0
significantly in your bag or pocket 25%,0.375,Positive,1
remaining super flexible and useful and,0.31666666666666665,Positive,1
then we've also got a 6.6k version 15 w,0.0,Neutral,0
charging so this one kind of does a,0.6,Positive,1
little bit of both things you can see it,-0.1875,Negative,0
props up like this i can dock my phone,0.0,Neutral,0
in this fashion or use it in that,0.0,Neutral,0
fashion it adjusts from 30° to 65° so it,0.0,Neutral,0
allows you to put your iphone in a more,0.5,Positive,1
comfortable viewing angle now this,0.4,Positive,1
actually features 15w wireless charging,0.0,Neutral,0
which is faster than some of the other,-0.125,Negative,0
comparable devices on the market so,0.0,Neutral,0
thanks again to anchor for sponsoring,0.2,Positive,1
this episode and let me know down in the,-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
comments which of these three devices is,0.0,Neutral,0
most compelling to you to charge,0.4,Positive,1
everything in one brick power bank with,0.0,Neutral,0
the display on it or this folding,0.0,Neutral,0
kickstand style power bank 6.6k 10k of,0.0,Neutral,0
power and this one is the only one,0.0,Neutral,0
that's capable of charging three devices,0.2,Positive,1
at once now the other thing i should,-0.125,Negative,0
mention is how do we interact we have,0.0,Neutral,0
things like these these little,-0.1875,Negative,0
controllers for quest and that's one of,0.0,Neutral,0
the things that enables console like,0.0,Neutral,0
gaming inside of the headset and,0.0,Neutral,0
pinpoint accuracy the hand and the eyes,0.0,Neutral,0
and by the way the eye tracking is,0.0,Neutral,0
fantastic the hand from a precision tool,0.4,Positive,1
perspective isn't always the best,1.0,Positive,1
depends on what you're doing precision,0.0,Neutral,0
requires in some cases a finer tip or a,0.0,Neutral,0
finer pointer than what your hand is,0.0,Neutral,0
capable of or or maybe even your eyes,0.2,Positive,1
for that matter and at the moment the,0.0,Neutral,0
majority of how you're navigating this,0.0,Neutral,0
thing is via your eyes and what is some,0.0,Neutral,0
actually uh pretty great eye tracking,0.525,Positive,1
that's in there it makes sense for the,0.0,Neutral,0
general type of consumption moving,0.05000000000000002,Positive,1
around a nice beautiful menu pinching,0.725,Positive,1
and pulling in order to change the scale,0.0,Neutral,0
of something for those types of tasks,0.0,Neutral,0
it's perfect but as soon as you jump,1.0,Positive,1
into some productivity which you can do,0.0,Neutral,0
with this headset i've got a macbook pro,0.0,Neutral,0
over here and when i put this headset on,0.0,Neutral,0
and they're on the same network they,0.0,Neutral,0
recognize the proximity the headset asks,0.0,Neutral,0
if i want to see what's on the laptop if,0.0,Neutral,0
i want to use the laptop within the,0.0,Neutral,0
headset and the image pops up and it's,0.0,Neutral,0
sharp and it's beautiful but then again,0.3625,Positive,1
interacting with it you feel like,0.0,Neutral,0
something is missing you're back to your,-0.1,Negative,0
hands being kind of the exclusive,0.6,Positive,1
instruments until you reach down and,-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
interact with the keyboard but the,0.0,Neutral,0
problem with looking at the keyboard,0.0,Neutral,0
is the same problem with looking at,0.0,Neutral,0
other objects that are close proximity,-0.125,Negative,0
inside of the headset they don't look,0.0,Neutral,0
that good this sort of augmented reality,0.7,Positive,1
experience looks best kind of at arms,0.8,Positive,1
length and as things get closer to here,0.0,Neutral,0
they become much more difficult to focus,0.0,Neutral,0
on so yes you can work inside the,0.0,Neutral,0
headset you're still manipulating an,0.0,Neutral,0
external instrument which is your,0.0,Neutral,0
keyboard and then you're kind of having,0.6,Positive,1
this real life augmented mixed,0.1,Positive,1
experience it's doable it is not my,0.0,Neutral,0
favorite thing to do and i immediately,0.5,Positive,1
want to take the headset off and just,0.0,Neutral,0
work on my laptop even though i've got,0.0,Neutral,0
this way bigger display can i imagine a,0.0,Neutral,0
future in which this is seamless and,0.05,Positive,1
this is comfortable absolutely but these,0.30000000000000004,Positive,1
are the limitations at the moment when,0.0,Neutral,0
people took a look at this device and,0.0,Neutral,0
saw the price tag i think they assumed,0.0,Neutral,0
there would be a productivity component,0.0,Neutral,0
because if you take that productivity,0.0,Neutral,0
piece out and what you're left with is a,0.0,Neutral,0
consumption device who is looking to,0.0,Neutral,0
spend,0.0,Neutral,0
3500 for a a consumption device and,0.0,Neutral,0
will'll just add it in a singular,0.0,Neutral,0
consumption device whereas if you get a,0.0,Neutral,0
big display for your living room you can,0.0,Neutral,0
enjoy that with other people sporting,0.1375,Positive,1
events and things like this every single,-0.07142857142857142,Negative,0
person that wants to enjoy this,0.30000000000000004,Positive,1
experience has to have their very own,0.78,Positive,1
"3,500 headset and if you do choose to",0.0,Neutral,0
share it well you're not using it at the,0.0,Neutral,0
same time that you're sharing it,0.0,Neutral,0
obviously now i don't think this thing,0.0,Neutral,0
will always be 3500 in fact i look at,0.0,Neutral,0
that price tag and i assume that apple,0.0,Neutral,0
was exclusively targeting early adopters,0.1,Positive,1
trying trying to iron out the kinks not,0.0,Neutral,0
necessarily interested in making a mass,0.25,Positive,1
market product with generation one but,0.0,Neutral,0
instead maybe going on a fact finding,0.0,Neutral,0
mission using enthusiasts as the guinea,0.0,Neutral,0
pigs to figure out what they actually,0.0,Neutral,0
should be doing inside of this segment i,0.0,Neutral,0
look at the quest and think to myself,0.0,Neutral,0
for the majority of people this is so,0.0,Neutral,0
much more useful right now in the sense,0.36190476190476195,Positive,1
that you can boot it up spend way less,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
money and start playing some pretty,0.25,Positive,1
immersive games immediately and still,0.0,Neutral,0
watching content and and doing all that,0.0,Neutral,0
kind of stuff now apple does have an,0.6,Positive,1
integration advantage in the fact that,0.0,Neutral,0
they have so much other hardware and and,-0.125,Negative,0
you're inside of their ecosystem already,0.0,Neutral,0
and you've got your facetime and your,0.0,Neutral,0
messages and so forth and that's,0.0,Neutral,0
exclusive of course to their hardware at,0.0,Neutral,0
the moment when it comes to headsets,0.0,Neutral,0
when you do need to input some text to,0.0,Neutral,0
potentially respond to a message or to,0.0,Neutral,0
try to be productive you will get an,0.0,Neutral,0
onscreen keyboard and then your gestures,0.0,Neutral,0
change and as long as you find the right,0.11785714285714285,Positive,1
proximity you can type on it like a,0.0,Neutral,0
floating keyboard another experience,0.0,Neutral,0
that i'm not particularly fond of but,-0.08333333333333333,Negative,0
i'm a person who just finished building,0.0,Neutral,0
a mechanical keyboard for my home setup,0.0,Neutral,0
because i like the tactile feel of it,0.0,Neutral,0
and i find that to be a pleasing,0.0,Neutral,0
experience and i find the experience of,0.0,Neutral,0
slamming my fingertips into air to be,0.0,Neutral,0
not that enjoyable does that mean it's,0.09375,Positive,1
not the future absolutely not because,-0.05,Negative,0
just like people said when we had,0.0,Neutral,0
smartphones and the iphone came out and,0.0,Neutral,0
it was a capacitive touchcreen and,0.0,Neutral,0
people tred to hang on to their,0.0,Neutral,0
blackberries for as long as they could,-0.05,Negative,0
saying tactile was the only way,0.0,Neutral,0
obviously they were wrong about that and,-0.25,Negative,0
people adjusted and people will adjust,0.0,Neutral,0
to this i don't know why but i just had,0.0,Neutral,0
it in my head that apple was closer than,0.0,Neutral,0
this even though med has been over there,0.0,Neutral,0
working on multiple generations we're,0.0,Neutral,0
still at the ground level of where this,0.0,Neutral,0
thing can and will eventually go so,0.0,Neutral,0
installing the headset you can see the,0.0,Neutral,0
way it fits on the back there it's kind,0.3,Positive,1
of cool like it spreads out around the,0.35,Positive,1
back of your head as you can see there,0.0,Neutral,0
immediately we're greeted by a passcode,0.0,Neutral,0
and my eyes are going to navigate if my,0.0,Neutral,0
eyes highlight a particular button i can,0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
tap highlight a different button and,0.0,Neutral,0
unlock the device okay so now we're,0.5,Positive,1
going to get a recording here of what,0.0,Neutral,0
the ui looks like i'll hit the home,0.0,Neutral,0
button you can see your app layout here,0.0,Neutral,0
i can pinch and move and swipe between,0.0,Neutral,0
my apps i can open something like free,0.2,Positive,1
form here for example is a drawing app,0.0,Neutral,0
you can see the tracking it's pretty,0.25,Positive,1
intuitive and then in order to navigate,0.0,Neutral,0
on the bottom of the frame we have this,0.0,Neutral,0
bar we can grab and,0.0,Neutral,0
move app or the display wherever we like,0.0,Neutral,0
and then beside there is an x if i want,0.0,Neutral,0
to close it out now if i grab the corner,0.0,Neutral,0
i can scale whichever scale i like so i,0.0,Neutral,0
can set up multiple apps multiple,0.0,Neutral,0
windows and then you start to understand,0.0,Neutral,0
why you've got so much horsepower in,0.2,Positive,1
here if at some point point this variety,0.0,Neutral,0
of apps exists that you're going to be,0.0,Neutral,0
running simultaneously you're going to,0.0,Neutral,0
need some decent computing power in,0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
order to run all that the web,0.0,Neutral,0
browser as i suggested kind of not the,0.6,Positive,1
ideal experience at the moment you're,0.9,Positive,1
using ey tracking on a web page which,0.0,Neutral,0
has all kinds of tiny little selection,-0.09375,Negative,0
points potential selection points the,0.0,Neutral,0
highlight contrast against white is not,0.0,Neutral,0
that great being able to tell that i'm,0.65,Positive,1
like highlighting this thumb and you can,0.0,Neutral,0
see it's so tiny like main maintaining,0.08333333333333333,Positive,1
your selection through your click it's,0.0,Neutral,0
really not the best experience at the,0.45,Positive,1
moment the pinch and scroll is extremely,-0.125,Negative,0
responsive and the other cool thing is,0.11249999999999999,Positive,1
how it sort of keystones itself to a,0.0,Neutral,0
variety of surfaces so as i go up,0.0,Neutral,0
towards the ceiling it starts to create,0.0,Neutral,0
that angle and if i want to push it back,0.0,Neutral,0
to a wall or pull it in close to my face,0.0,Neutral,0
like this the thing you realize is the,0.0,Neutral,0
limitations of the field of view so if i,0.0,Neutral,0
bring it in this tight where i can,-0.17857142857142858,Negative,0
really appreciate the resolution i,0.2,Positive,1
actually i mean without making the,-0.3125,Negative,0
screen basically ipad size otherwise my,0.0,Neutral,0
field of view gets i you know i just,0.0,Neutral,0
can't really take in the information,0.2,Positive,1
that's on the sides of my vision at a,0.0,Neutral,0
very close point of reference if i push,0.2,Positive,1
the screen out further the text the,0.0,Neutral,0
fonts and things don't have the same,0.0,Neutral,0
level of sharpness as they do when,0.0,Neutral,0
they're up close so you know maybe when,0.0,Neutral,0
it comes to productivity i just haven't,0.0,Neutral,0
found the perfect setup yet it could be,1.0,Positive,1
possible the nature of the headset work,0.0,Neutral,0
environments collaborative environments,0.0,Neutral,0
i think for the time being there are,0.0,Neutral,0
still some pretty huge advantages having,0.32500000000000007,Positive,1
your eyes available and and being sort,0.4,Positive,1
of conducive to communication depending,0.0,Neutral,0
on the type of environment that you work,0.0,Neutral,0
in and then it's also just the fatigue,0.0,Neutral,0
of wearing a headset for an extended,0.0,Neutral,0
period of time like even me right there,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
i'm starting on the forehead getting get,0.0,Neutral,0
the red mark there you start to feel,0.0,Neutral,0
that weight on there it's a really weird,-0.5,Negative,0
product to evaluate because it is a,0.0,Neutral,0
thing that apple is selling right now,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
"for 3,500 and as we know when apple",0.0,Neutral,0
launches something it's about to go,0.0,Neutral,0
mainstream that's sort of how it has,0.0,Neutral,0
been but i just feel that the headset,0.0,Neutral,0
proposition at the moment the way that,0.0,Neutral,0
people are using it the software,0.0,Neutral,0
availability and so forth outside the,0.0,Neutral,0
realm of the technology that's built,0.0,Neutral,0
into it it's mostly being used for,0.5,Positive,1
consumption and the value that people,0.0,Neutral,0
put on that is really unique to that to,0.375,Positive,1
those individuals there are enthusiasts,0.0,Neutral,0
in different categories like say,0.0,Neutral,0
headphones for example that will spend a,0.0,Neutral,0
boatload of money on a very particular,0.21666666666666667,Positive,1
experience and yes you will have a,0.0,Neutral,0
tremendously immersive movie watching,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
experience on the vision pro sitting on,0.0,Neutral,0
an airplane i mean i i don't know what,-0.3125,Negative,0
can even compete with it at the moment,0.0,Neutral,0
but apple launching this device at 3500,0.0,Neutral,0
implies something different to me that,0.0,Neutral,0
that is not how they view the device and,0.0,Neutral,0
that they really do want it to become or,0.2,Positive,1
be received as a tool that's capable of,0.2,Positive,1
so much more but that's going to take,0.5,Positive,1
time and i don't know if you want to,0.0,Neutral,0
"spend your 3,500 today as you wait for",0.0,Neutral,0
that to come or if you want to wait for,0.0,Neutral,0
generation 2 and if you want to movie,0.0,Neutral,0
watching device that you can wear on an,0.0,Neutral,0
airplane then there are other options,-0.125,Negative,0
that aren't going to be nearly as,0.1,Positive,1
expensive but it's apple and there are,-0.5,Negative,0
apple enthusiasts there's people that,0.0,Neutral,0
want to be on the forefront they just,0.0,Neutral,0
want to try the latest hardware,0.5,Positive,1
regardless and of course we've got all,0.0,Neutral,0
these memes of people using this thing,0.0,Neutral,0
on the subway and making it look like,0.0,Neutral,0
they're doing incredibly productive,0.9,Positive,1
things when in reality for me at the,0.0,Neutral,0
moment that is not the strength of these,0.0,Neutral,0
style of devices and interfaces now on,0.0,Neutral,0
to the topic of what this all means for,0.0,Neutral,0
the future apple is not exclusively,0.0,Neutral,0
guilty for sticking people into headsets,-0.5,Negative,0
because they launched the vision pro the,0.0,Neutral,0
headset thing has been ongoing and it,0.0,Neutral,0
will continue to go i mean when facebook,-0.3125,Negative,0
invested in oculus and eventually became,0.0,Neutral,0
meta they were making a big bet on the,0.0,Neutral,0
fact that people were going to spend,0.0,Neutral,0
some time inside of headsets humans,0.0,Neutral,0
continued to ref towards convenience and,0.0,Neutral,0
continue to want to have new and,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
exciting experiences without moving a,0.3,Positive,1
muscle the thing will happen and the,0.0,Neutral,0
experiences will get so good that it'll,0.7,Positive,1
be impossible to ignore and we're going,-0.6666666666666666,Negative,0
to have to continue to make efforts to,0.0,Neutral,0
exercise personal agency over our,0.0,Neutral,0
discipline around devices like this,0.0,Neutral,0
because the potential for persuasion is,0.0,Neutral,0
so great i mean who are you granting the,0.24375000000000002,Positive,1
opportunity to manip ulate your feelings,0.0,Neutral,0
and behavior while you're strapped into,0.0,Neutral,0
a sensory overload it'll all be very,0.2,Positive,1
interesting to watch i know there have,0.5,Positive,1
been some articles of people returning,0.0,Neutral,0
these things for whatever reason we can,0.0,Neutral,0
speculate maybe their expectation around,0.0,Neutral,0
value,0.0,Neutral,0
proposition was not met maybe they,0.0,Neutral,0
started to panic about their futuristic,0.0,Neutral,0
life inside of a headset maybe the thing,0.0,Neutral,0
was too heavy as it sat on their nose,-0.2,Negative,0
and they didn't have the energy to adopt,0.0,Neutral,0
it one thing i said to will when we were,0.0,Neutral,0
talking about this product as a,0.0,Neutral,0
substitute for all the other displays,-0.125,Negative,0
and screens and devices that we already,0.0,Neutral,0
have in our lives i thought about tesla,0.0,Neutral,0
and how when tesla tried to push the,0.0,Neutral,0
world towards an electric vehicle they,0.0,Neutral,0
didn't just come with a commuter car,0.0,Neutral,0
they had to come with something that got,0.0,Neutral,0
people excited they had to come with,0.375,Positive,1
something that could compete in a,0.0,Neutral,0
straight line they had to put out these,0.2,Positive,1
performance models that prior to that,0.0,Neutral,0
weren't associated or affiliated with,0.0,Neutral,0
electric vehicles i mean they had the,-0.3125,Negative,0
roadster first but then in the model s,0.25,Positive,1
and then eventually the plaid why did,0.0,Neutral,0
the thing have to be 0 to 60 in 2,0.0,Neutral,0
seconds when something is better in this,0.5,Positive,1
variety of categories and it's a new,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
thing that you have to adopt which,0.0,Neutral,0
requires a completely new behavior like,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
remembering to charge your car or,0.0,Neutral,0
planning out your trek when you're about,0.0,Neutral,0
to go on your road trip these are,0.0,Neutral,0
annoying things to have to adjust to as,-0.8,Negative,0
a human who's embedded inside of their,0.0,Neutral,0
habits the mandate for them is to,0.0,Neutral,0
provide an experience that's so,0.0,Neutral,0
obviously better and measurably better,0.5,Positive,1
that people put down their old tech and,-0.02777777777777779,Negative,0
are willing to learn a new habit and i,0.19318181818181818,Positive,1
don't think that's the case right now i,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
would still rather watch a movie on a,0.0,Neutral,0
big beautiful display with a beautiful,0.5666666666666667,Positive,1
sound system and i certainly would still,0.30714285714285716,Positive,1
rather get work done on the variety of,0.0,Neutral,0
devices that i have that can do that,0.0,Neutral,0
this is a difficult thing to recommend,-0.5,Negative,0
you have to give apple credit for,0.0,Neutral,0
essentially looking at all the existing,0.0,Neutral,0
materials and finishes on modern,0.2,Positive,1
headsets and saying we'll use none of,0.0,Neutral,0
those but this has a battery in it like,0.0,Neutral,0
some of these materials are just light,0.4,Positive,1
and they work i don't know what it is,0.0,Neutral,0
for me but there is something about the,0.0,Neutral,0
visual of the headset the intentional,0.0,Neutral,0
blocking of of your human sensory there,0.0,Neutral,0
something symbolic about that but,0.0,Neutral,0
there's something about when apple does,0.0,Neutral,0
it that you start to imagine the world,0.0,Neutral,0
doing it i mean they've just had that,-0.3125,Negative,0
kind of impact on the tech segment not,0.6,Positive,1
just that people will be to adopt it cuz,0.0,Neutral,0
they're so comfortable and have so much,0.30000000000000004,Positive,1
enthusiasm around that brand but also,0.0,Neutral,0
that other brands themselves will race,-0.125,Negative,0
to get into the segment so they're not,0.0,Neutral,0
left behind because apple has always,-0.2,Negative,0
sort of been that arbiter in that regard,0.0,Neutral,0
it's really when it shrinks when you,0.2,Positive,1
have this in something the size of those,0.0,Neutral,0
rayb bands what do you mean you don't,-0.3125,Negative,0
have your assistant on your face,0.0,Neutral,0
obviously you're wearing your assistant,0.0,Neutral,0
today because you're useless without,-0.5,Negative,0
your assistant i'm curious what you guys,-0.1,Negative,0
think and this has been out for a little,-0.1875,Negative,0
while now we've had some time to digest,0.0,Neutral,0
are you actually considering buying this,0.0,Neutral,0
what price would this need to be for you,0.0,Neutral,0
to consider buying it what is the,0.0,Neutral,0
optimal price for a headset or any,0.0,Neutral,0
consumption device for that matter well,0.0,Neutral,0
for you or for the masses or do they do,0.0,Neutral,0
a two-tiered system like this is the,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro is the vision next set up for,0.0,Neutral,0
widespread adoption and and therefore a,0.0,Neutral,0
little bit more figured out ready for,0.1708333333333333,Positive,1
prime time than those of us that are,0.0,Neutral,0
crazy like myself are buying these pro,-0.6,Negative,0
model,0.0,Neutral,0
have you guys bought the vision pro will,0.0,Neutral,0
you buy the vision pro if the vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
was available in your market would you,0.4,Positive,1
have already bought it let me know in,0.0,Neutral,0
the comments i'm genuinely curious this,-0.1,Negative,0
is a unique moment in human history the,0.1875,Positive,1
launch of this particular device that is,0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
arguably the biggest tech company in the,0.0,Neutral,0
world taking their first crack at maybe,0.25,Positive,1
the future of all gadgets the headset,0.0,Neutral,0
which eventually will probably just be,0.0,Neutral,0
glasses or implants or contact lenses,0.0,Neutral,0
we're just just maybe maybe maybe just,0.0,Neutral,0
robots maybe we can maybe we're just the,0.0,Neutral,0
brain in the jar with the electrodes,0.0,Neutral,0
like why do we need all this you need,0.0,Neutral,0
the whole body for useless sack of,-0.15,Negative,0
potatoes what do you need the body for,0.0,Neutral,0
i'm going to go do some activities now,0.0,Neutral,0
doing activities with my,0.0,Neutral,0
body,0.0,Neutral,0
like what that's wild like real yeah i,0.15000000000000002,Positive,1
mean your eyes are close your there too,-0.3125,Negative,0
much teeth i think i don't know um i,0.2,Positive,1
want to make a review come help me all,0.0,Neutral,0
right sounds good all right meet you,0.4238095238095238,Positive,1
downstairs all right if you want like a,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
normal review of this thing i can't,0.15,Positive,1
recommend enough to go watch to go watch,0.0,Neutral,0
marquez brownley his is fantastic this,0.4,Positive,1
is a different like i kind of have a,0.3,Positive,1
different take on this and different,0.0,Neutral,0
questions and that's what this,0.0,Neutral,0
is but marquez is really,0.2,Positive,1
good what is this thing that i'm holding,0.7,Positive,1
literally,0.0,Neutral,0
you how do you find it i've had it for,0.0,Neutral,0
like an hour yeah okay can you put,0.5,Positive,1
windows up now if you want yeah so like,0.0,Neutral,0
i can put a window up now but when i,0.0,Neutral,0
start walking they like go away they,0.0,Neutral,0
fade,0.0,Neutral,0
away cool enjoy take care all right,0.3452380952380952,Positive,1
music,0.0,Neutral,0
too you get a random pile of bricks an,-0.5,Negative,0
old toilet i found the restroom and a,0.03333333333333334,Positive,1
bunch of random wooden poles there's,-0.25,Negative,0
more,0.5,Positive,1
poles hi let's pile on that boat and,0.0,Neutral,0
leave and as you can,0.0,Neutral,0
see but later in this video we're going,0.0,Neutral,0
to,0.0,Neutral,0
aund and,0.0,Neutral,0
also super island but furnace we're,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
going to head over,0.0,Neutral,0
to strategy for interacting with people,0.0,Neutral,0
they gaslight you into thinking so if,0.0,Neutral,0
you're moving a lot while you're moving,0.0,Neutral,0
this thing comes up that says tracking,0.0,Neutral,0
fail so it doesn't track if you're,-0.5,Negative,0
moving a lot says nothing for the,0.0,Neutral,0
sensors to like lock on to it doesn't,0.0,Neutral,0
know where to put stuff but standing at,0.0,Neutral,0
a subway stop watching a mr be video is,0.0,Neutral,0
a pretty special it's a pretty special,0.3035714285714286,Positive,1
experience hold on jordan let me try to,0.0,Neutral,0
figure out how do,0.0,Neutral,0
i what do you think,0.0,Neutral,0
it's interesting i i can't imagine i,0.5,Positive,1
can't imagine why you're looking at uh,0.0,Neutral,0
i'm looking at you right now oh okay i,0.39285714285714285,Positive,1
can see you clear as day you got on a,0.10000000000000002,Positive,1
blue tie with a beautiful tie pin at the,0.425,Positive,1
top so i can see you i get off here,0.5,Positive,1
enjoy your adventure,0.4,Positive,1
bye-bye uh i opened up apple tv and it,0.0,Neutral,0
was like this window right here de,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
jordan and as he started to move the,0.0,Neutral,0
window went away with the back with the,0.0,Neutral,0
subway car you can't use windows if,0.0,Neutral,0
you're in like a if there's a lot of,0.0,Neutral,0
like kinetic movement it i imagine it,0.0,Neutral,0
works in an airplane cuz the airplane is,0.0,Neutral,0
so steady but this is a subway and it's,0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
bouncing so i got to wait till we get,0.0,Neutral,0
music,0.0,Neutral,0
there i thisen tether to my,0.0,Neutral,0
iphone it seems to be working well,0.0,Neutral,0
enough but for some reason when i try to,0.0,Neutral,0
open safari it won't,0.0,Neutral,0
music,0.0,Neutral,0
open,0.0,Neutral,0
i was just responding to text,0.0,Neutral,0
music,0.0,Neutral,0
messages no way you're the only person i,0.0,Neutral,0
wanted to be in case wait is it case i,0.0,Neutral,0
can't tell did you not tell no,0.0,Neutral,0
way,0.0,Neutral,0
like oh my god no way i'm actually freak,0.0,Neutral,0
the idea that i could have my whole like,0.2,Positive,1
computer digital online world that,0.0,Neutral,0
exists in the real world that's,0.2,Positive,1
what that's what feels like is bigger,0.0,Neutral,0
than ar or vr like i have the oculus,0.0,Neutral,0
it's great but it definitely feels like,0.4,Positive,1
a toy this feels like a little glimpse,-0.1875,Negative,0
into the future of what computing could,0.0,Neutral,0
be,0.0,Neutral,0
like down the road why is everybody,-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
staring at,0.0,Neutral,0
me do i look as ridiculous as those,-0.3333333333333333,Negative,0
people make me feel like i look no,0.0,Neutral,0
you're just your eyes are glowing how,0.0,Neutral,0
you,0.0,Neutral,0
doing jord you're standing right in,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
front of my mr beast video come right,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
there okay years ago this used to be a,0.5,Positive,1
bar yep yeah you want to walk under,0.0,Neutral,0
this so the idea of spatial computing it,0.0,Neutral,0
doesn't make sense to me when i'm,0.0,Neutral,0
sitting in my office i've got multiple,0.0,Neutral,0
streams but right now i'm like in the,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
city i'm in the middle of time square,0.0,Neutral,0
i've got my virtual keyboard here i've,0.0,Neutral,0
got apple tv there i got youtube safaris,0.0,Neutral,0
open in here and it all kind of,0.3,Positive,1
works like this what i've got going on,0.0,Neutral,0
right now this is wild it's impossible,-0.09365079365079365,Negative,0
for me to imagine that you can't see,0.0,Neutral,0
what i can see everything seems so real,0.2,Positive,1
and then i can just stand,0.0,Neutral,0
up what up,0.0,Neutral,0
man,0.0,Neutral,0
music,0.0,Neutral,0
guys are done,0.0,Neutral,0
it thank,0.0,Neutral,0
you next guest,0.0,Neutral,0
music,0.0,Neutral,0
next,0.0,Neutral,0
music,0.0,Neutral,0
the butterfly is eating my,0.0,Neutral,0
donut,0.0,Neutral,0
the concept for this video was to run,0.0,Neutral,0
around new york city wearing these cuz i,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
thought that would be funny i think it,0.25,Positive,1
was funny but something happened,0.25,Positive,1
something happened today that was,0.0,Neutral,0
completely unexpected and that's,0.1,Positive,1
something i don't think anyone else has,0.0,Neutral,0
really touched on none of the reviews,0.2,Positive,1
i've seen or read none of them really,0.2,Positive,1
put to words what i experienced so when,0.8,Positive,1
you take these off they kind of go to,0.6,Positive,1
sleep like your phone and when you put,0.0,Neutral,0
them back on you have to unlock them,0.0,Neutral,0
they scan your eyeballs and then to,0.0,Neutral,0
start screen recording go through the it,0.0,Neutral,0
takes a second so rather than doing that,0.0,Neutral,0
i just left these on the entire day um,0.0,Neutral,0
the like 2 and 1/2 hour battery pack you,0.0,Neutral,0
can plug into a fatter batteries so i,0.0,Neutral,0
never ran out of battery power and after,0.0,Neutral,0
a couple of hours of running around the,0.0,Neutral,0
streets of new york as did not in a,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
controlled environment my brain sort of,0.0,Neutral,0
clicked and it just forgot that i was,0.0,Neutral,0
looking through cameras and screens and,0.0,Neutral,0
it just it it took what it saw as,0.0,Neutral,0
reality and that is where this this,0.0,Neutral,0
that's where the that profound moment,0.08333333333333333,Positive,1
came from and what occurred to me as i,0.0,Neutral,0
was sitting there in time square on a,0.0,Neutral,0
bench strangers all around me the real,0.2,Positive,1
world moving all around me but i had,0.0,Neutral,0
like a big screen up where i was,0.0,Neutral,0
watching a mr beast video and then over,0.0,Neutral,0
here i had this keyboard that i could,0.0,Neutral,0
interact with and over here i had my,0.0,Neutral,0
imessages and over here i had my apple,0.0,Neutral,0
tv and then all my apps and they're,0.0,Neutral,0
floating in time square in the middle of,0.0,Neutral,0
new york city they're floating there and,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
i'm actually there and there's actual,0.0,Neutral,0
humans around me and in that,0.0,Neutral,0
moment i was like holy this is it,0.0,Neutral,0
this is the future of computing that,0.0,Neutral,0
everyone's been promising for like the,0.2,Positive,1
last 15 years this is something that,0.0,Neutral,0
like let me like truly peak into where,0.0,Neutral,0
we're where all of this is going this,0.0,Neutral,0
isn't the like the future of ar or vr,0.0,Neutral,0
this is the i think this is the future,0.0,Neutral,0

they figure out how to make these na be,0.0,Neutral,0

you know maybe they look like these,0.0,Neutral,0
glasses or something even smaller that,0.0,Neutral,0
that is what it'll be in the morning you,0.0,Neutral,0
won't remember your phone you put it on,0.0,Neutral,0
and then that's it and it's like hold on,0.0,Neutral,0
i've got a call hey what's up mom i'll,0.0,Neutral,0
call you back you look great by the way,0.4,Positive,1
and that's what it's going to look like,0.0,Neutral,0
and these show you that these reveal,0.0,Neutral,0
that i'm like as a geek that was the,0.0,Neutral,0
thing i've been looking for forever and,0.0,Neutral,0
they did it right here on a product that,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
has like a product that is so new this,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
has been out for 12 hours and i felt it,0.0,Neutral,0
so i don't know that i recommend you,0.0,Neutral,0
should buy one of these at,0.0,Neutral,0
"4,000 because i can promise you this",0.0,Neutral,0
this will be the worst vision pro apple,-1.0,Negative,0
ever ships it is going to get so much,0.2,Positive,1
better all right and maybe i'll make,0.39285714285714285,Positive,1
another video that that's that that,0.0,Neutral,0
makes more sense of this,0.5,Positive,1
music,0.0,Neutral,0
but in summary by apple stock cuz this,0.0,Neutral,0
is without a doubt a new product,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1

it turns out the answer is yes.,0.0,Neutral,0

another apple thing is that they tend to be selective,0.0,Neutral,0
"about publishing their specs,",0.0,Neutral,0
and they opted not to publish a field of view number,0.0,Neutral,0

"speaker_01 not linus's actual fov,",0.0,Neutral,0
speaker_01 which would be a little bit larger,-0.09375,Negative,0

"speaker_01 and look at this grid on the wall,",0.0,Neutral,0

and put it on like this,",0.5333333333333333,Positive,1

same, but it actually gets much larger, so before i could only see about the
edges of this,",0.0,Neutral,0
"speaker_01 now i can see all the way out to here, which is why you can get
between like 90 up all the way to 110 on this,",0.0,Neutral,0

headset, it is a spatial computing device for professional work,",0.1,Positive,1

"look at this, you guys.",0.0,Neutral,0
"everything around me,",0.0,Neutral,0

with no discernible frame rate drops.,0.0,Neutral,0
it is.,0.0,Neutral,0
far and away the best that i have ever seen on a headset.,0.55,Positive,1
and that is thanks to the same m2 chip,0.1,Positive,1
as the current macbooks.,0.0,Neutral,0
"and this too, apple's environmental mapping",0.0,Neutral,0
and the solidity of the placement of virtual objects,0.0,Neutral,0
in the real world makes everything else i've ever seen,0.2,Positive,1
look like a cheap toy in comparison.,0.4,Positive,1
"unfortunately, the whole thing falls apart",-0.15,Negative,0
the second you try to interact with the game.,-0.2,Negative,0
"hey, remember when i said no frame rate drops?",0.0,Neutral,0
"in a traditional inside-out headset like the quest 3 or the psvr 2, not only are
there cameras",0.0,Neutral,0
"tracking where your hands are, there are gyros, thank you, and accelerometers
inside the controllers",0.0,Neutral,0

times when your",0.375,Positive,1
"hands are not visible or the cameras temporarily lose tracking for some reason.
without that",0.0,Neutral,0

"the apple vision pro was to blame, not my skills.",0.0,Neutral,0
"hey, hey, hey, hey",0.0,Neutral,0
"and honestly, playing anything but the slowest pace",0.6,Positive,1
of ipad apps made me feel pretty much the same way.,0.15,Positive,1
i just immediately wanted my stupid slab of glass back.,-0.39999999999999997,Negative,0
"of course, we went into this knowing",0.0,Neutral,0
the vision pro isn't a vr gaming headset.,0.0,Neutral,0
so why don't we move on to one of its greatest strengths?,1.0,Positive,1
putting an enormous,0.0,Neutral,0
"high fidelity display anywhere you want,",0.16,Positive,1
and then using that to play real games.,0.2,Positive,1
"now, i went into this assuming",0.0,Neutral,0
that getting windows working on this headset,0.0,Neutral,0
"would be a chore and a half, or at least 1.3 chores.",-0.23333333333333334,Negative,0
"i mean, apple doesn't even let you buy the vision pro",-0.3125,Negative,0
if you don't already have a reasonably current iphone.,0.0,Neutral,0
"but as it turns out, the process is incredibly simple.",0.0,Neutral,0
"if you only wanna play games,",0.0,Neutral,0
all you've gotta do is download the steam link ipad app,0.0,Neutral,0
"from the app store,",0.0,Neutral,0

what kind of absolute mad lad would have a tv this big?,0.04375000000000001,Positive,1
wee,0.0,Neutral,0
it's a little laggy.,-0.1875,Negative,0
would i find it easier to play just looking,0.0,Neutral,0
at the laptop screen with the 12 milliseconds,0.0,Neutral,0
or so of pass-through?,0.0,Neutral,0
"dude, with all the just like compression blocking",0.0,Neutral,0
"and everything and the fact that this is only at 1080p,",0.0,Neutral,0
the experience like this is pretty similar.,0.125,Positive,1
wee,0.0,Neutral,0
"of course a key difference is that i can't put that display anywhere that i want
and",0.0,Neutral,0
"as much as i might complain about the latency. it's good enough for most gamers
in",0.35,Positive,1
most games for example in forza assuming you're a halfway decent driver,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
"you'll probably find that frame pacing is more important than a little bit of
lag here or there",0.23750000000000002,Positive,1
"but if you were to play other games competitive games even driving ones like say
rocket league",-0.125,Negative,0
the latency is too high to for example,0.16,Positive,1
"counter a last-second fake out from your opponent. steam link also has some big
limitations",-0.25,Negative,0
"regardless of which headset you're using the highest resolution that you can
stream is 1080p and",0.0,Neutral,0
"you can only play games but that my friends is where sunshine and moonlight come
in",0.0,Neutral,0
"and no i'm not telling you to go outside sunshine available on the lizard bite
github",0.2,Positive,1
"page allows you to easily convert your pc or laptop into a streaming server then
the moonlight",0.43333333333333335,Positive,1
"ipad app on your vision pro will give you full access to your windows machine at
up to 4k 120",0.35,Positive,1
frames per second though it should be noted you're going to need one,0.0,Neutral,0
"heck of a wireless access point in order to hit that consistently 4k here we go
i'm not even going",0.25,Positive,1
"to try 120 right now our wi-fi in this part of the office is uh not great. the
spatiality of the audio",-0.05714285714285716,Negative,0
"is incredible. like that tv's behind me now, no question. unfortunately with our
wi-fi on the",0.0,Neutral,0
"sets not being as good as we'd like sunshine and moonlight didn't perform that
great in gaming",0.75,Positive,1
"but the big killer app is not really games it's the ability to just use a
windows pc",-0.05,Negative,0
with a virtual desktop in the vision pro and for that it works freaking great.,0.8,Positive,1
like look at this. honestly alex i gotta say the latency feels very very similar,0.3,Positive,1
to the native connection to the macbook.,0.0,Neutral,0
speaker_01 try it.,0.0,Neutral,0
"this is going to be the thing that finally
breaks apple and makes",0.0,Neutral,0
"them integrate touch into mac os the fact that people are going to be sitting
there in their",0.0,Neutral,0
"vision pro and just want to click on things and then they're going to introduce
it and everyone's",0.0,Neutral,0
"going to be like wow it's so obvious sometimes it's nice to be able to tap on
things and then",0.3,Positive,1
"they're going to put touch screens on macs, this is it mark my words. and if it
doesn't happen then it",0.0,Neutral,0
"is only because of apple's complete and utter stubbornness there's no other
reason.",0.040625,Positive,1
"wow it is struggling a lot more in this environment but over at the lab i did not have the
same problem",0.19999999999999998,Positive,1
"it was a little laggy, it was fine. yeah once again i've got serious latency
issues which underscores",-0.03472222222222221,Negative,0
"that you are going to need a really nice modern access point for the best
possible experience on this.",0.45,Positive,1
"i'll show you a little bit of contrasting footage here to give you some idea of
what this is supposed to look like,",-0.1875,Negative,0
"yeah. unfortunately, that's not the kind we have here on the set so using
windows on a big old virtual spatial display?",0.049999999999999996,Positive,1
"incredible. the latency is very similar to using it on the macbook, which means",0.45,Positive,1
"there is some, regardless of your access point,",0.0,Neutral,0
"but it's very, very usable",0.26,Positive,1
and worth the trade-off of the giant display.,0.15,Positive,1
the only thing that i'd say is different,0.0,Neutral,0
is that it doesn't have that really cool,0.35,Positive,1
augmented reality connect thing,0.0,Neutral,0
"that is such a mwah, it just works moment.",0.0,Neutral,0
"now, if you do have some weirdness,",0.0,Neutral,0
part of that comes down to the way,-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
that apple made their wireless chip set,0.0,Neutral,0
and apparently setting your router to use channel 149,0.05,Positive,1
can help solve it.,0.0,Neutral,0
"bottom line,",0.0,Neutral,0
"incredible for non-competitive games. with a powerful gpu in the streaming
system,",0.6,Positive,1
"i'd say this is pretty much the definitive way to experience baldur's
gate 3 or something from the witcher series.",0.225,Positive,1
"but if you're a competitive gamer, you could get nearly the same field of view while 
having much lower latency for a lot less money.",0.03333333333333335,Positive,1
"so, gaming perspective aside then, let's take a look at the vision pro more in the
ways that apple intended, which is where the device starts to get in some ways
cooler, but in other ways",0.1875,Positive,1
"a bit more complicated. i've already stated that this is the best video pass-
through that i've",0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
"encountered by a metric mile, but pass-through has never been a core function of
a headset to quite",0.0,Neutral,0
"the same degree before. on a psvr or most pc headsets, it's a convenience
feature so you can",0.25,Positive,1
"find your water bottle in between rounds, but on the vision pro, the expectation
is that you're",0.0,Neutral,0
doing work.,0.0,Neutral,0
"probably in an office with other humans while in pass-through mode for extended
periods of time, which...",-0.125,Negative,0
can get rather strange because it literally warps your perception of reality.,-0.05,Negative,0
"oh yeah, that's really disorientating.",0.2,Positive,1
"they won't be seeing it in 3d, so they won't realize how this tree, like...",0.0,Neutral,0
"you see, the camera distorts your perception of objects,",0.0,Neutral,0
"particularly ones that are too close, and",0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
"while the pass-through is shockingly low latency, allowing you to easily dodge a
thrown object,",0.21666666666666667,Positive,1
oh,0.0,Neutral,0
the perception of depth of really everything around you,0.2,Positive,1
is going to be a bit off.,0.0,Neutral,0
the good news is that your brain,0.7,Positive,1
is really good at compensating for this.,0.7,Positive,1
"so when you hear people say,",0.0,Neutral,0
"""yeah, the first 30 minutes was kind of weird,",0.11666666666666665,Positive,1
"but then it just clicked.""",0.0,Neutral,0
you can expect to have a pretty similar experience.,0.125,Positive,1
"the weird one though,",-0.5,Negative,0
is that your brain also clicks the other way.,-0.125,Negative,0
"so when you take the headset off,",0.0,Neutral,0
"it's typical to have a minute or two of,",-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
"""whoa, hold on a second,""",0.0,Neutral,0
before things click back into place.,0.0,Neutral,0
"speaking of things clicking into place,",0.0,Neutral,0
a big pet peeve of mine with this product,0.0,Neutral,0
is the complete inability to grab something,0.1,Positive,1

while you go about the rest of your life.,0.0,Neutral,0
"in fairness to apple,",0.0,Neutral,0
the accuracy of the way that it,0.0,Neutral,0
takes an object and keeps it exactly where you left it,0.125,Positive,1
is incredible.,0.9,Positive,1
it's just that i don't always want to have to,0.0,Neutral,0
carry things around with me,0.0,Neutral,0
"when i want to refer back to them, like this script.",0.0,Neutral,0
another thing that bummed me out,0.0,Neutral,0
anytime i spent an extended period and pass through,-0.1,Negative,0
was the video fidelity.,0.0,Neutral,0
"and look, i don't want to take anything away",0.0,Neutral,0
"from what apple has achieved here,",0.0,Neutral,0

"there is some, regardless of your access point,",0.0,Neutral,0
"but it's very, very usable",0.26,Positive,1
and worth the trade-off of the giant display.,0.15,Positive,1
the only thing that i'd say is different,0.0,Neutral,0
is that it doesn't have that really cool,0.35,Positive,1
augmented reality connect thing,0.0,Neutral,0
"that is such a mwah, it just works moment.",0.0,Neutral,0
"now, if you do have some weirdness,",0.0,Neutral,0
part of that comes down to the way,-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
that apple made their wireless chip set,0.0,Neutral,0
and apparently setting your router to use channel 149,0.05,Positive,1
can help solve it.,0.0,Neutral,0

ways that apple intended, which is where the device starts to get in some ways
cooler, but in other ways",0.1875,Positive,1

thrown object,",0.21666666666666667,Positive,1
oh,0.0,Neutral,0
the perception of depth of really everything around you,0.2,Positive,1
is going to be a bit off.,0.0,Neutral,0
the good news is that your brain,0.7,Positive,1
is really good at compensating for this.,0.7,Positive,1
"so when you hear people say,",0.0,Neutral,0

is that your brain also clicks the other way.,-0.125,Negative,0

before things click back into place.,0.0,Neutral,0

while you go about the rest of your life.,0.0,Neutral,0
"in fairness to apple,",0.0,Neutral,0
the accuracy of the way that it,0.0,Neutral,0
takes an object and keeps it exactly where you left it,0.125,Positive,1
is incredible.,0.9,Positive,1
it's just that i don't always want to have to,0.0,Neutral,0
carry things around with me,0.0,Neutral,0
"when i want to refer back to them, like this script.",0.0,Neutral,0
another thing that bummed me out,0.0,Neutral,0
anytime i spent an extended period and pass through,-0.1,Negative,0
was the video fidelity.,0.0,Neutral,0
"and look, i don't want to take anything away",0.0,Neutral,0
"from what apple has achieved here,",0.0,Neutral,0
but i could never forget that i was looking,0.0,Neutral,0
at a video feed of the world through phone cameras.,0.0,Neutral,0
compounding this issue is the fact that virtual content,0.0,Neutral,0
rendered by the vision pro is so high fidelity,0.16,Positive,1
and so vibrant that the real world ends up looking,0.18333333333333335,Positive,1
drab and dull by comparison.,-0.2916666666666667,Negative,0

this is a color checker classic in the real world.,0.18333333333333335,Positive,1
see the difference?,0.0,Neutral,0
another major issue is motion blur.,0.0625,Positive,1
while the pixel response times of this micro oled display,0.0,Neutral,0
"allow objects to look extremely crisp even when in motion,",0.25,Positive,1
"as you move your head,",0.0,Neutral,0
it's normal for the whole world to end up looking,0.175,Positive,1

in order to compensate,0.0,Neutral,0

while we spent a lot of time so far talking about things,0.0,Neutral,0
"you can do with the vision pro,",0.0,Neutral,0
i actually spent most of my time with the device,0.2,Positive,1
"doing what you are supposed to do,",0.0,Neutral,0

i love being able to take private notes in a meeting,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
or work on sensitive material in a group setting.,0.1,Positive,1
but the problem is that,0.0,Neutral,0
it cuts both ways.,0.0,Neutral,0
one of the first things that i wanted to do,0.25,Positive,1
was share a document with someone and mark it up together.,0.0,Neutral,0
and yeah.,0.0,Neutral,0
because there's no obvious way to mirror,0.0,Neutral,0
"my macbook's display, i had to use a bizarre workaround",0.4,Positive,1
that involved screen sharing from inside the vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
to a video conference with someone who was sitting there,0.0,Neutral,0
on a laptop next to me in the same room.,0.0,Neutral,0
"also, even if all you want to do is work privately,",0.0,Neutral,0
the whole setup can be a bit of a chore.,0.2,Positive,1
"i mean, the vision pro sounds like having your own personal colin",0.09583333333333333,Positive,1

example, nicole.",0.2,Positive,1
"here's a real person doing real work. for a fraction of the cost of a vision

"again, i appreciate this thing for the technological marvel that it is.",0.0,Neutral,0
a 4k display in a single square inch?,-0.07142857142857142,Negative,0
"but for optimal text clarity, you need to use most of those pixels,",0.5,Positive,1

watching 3d movies in this thing is second to none.,0.0,Neutral,0
i think it's even safe to say that watching encanto on the vision pro in 3d,0.5,Positive,1
is the absolute best way to experience that movie.,0.6,Positive,1

absolutely amazing.,0.6000000000000001,Positive,1

you're gonna be ready to look back on those memories,0.1,Positive,1

"my smartphone, guess what,",0.0,Neutral,0
is also a worse version of everything else,-0.4,Negative,0

ridiculous fascinating though i just,0.18333333333333332,Positive,1
wonder what you can see while you're i,0.0,Neutral,0
can see everything and more hang on why,0.5,Positive,1
am i even making this video you can only,0.0,Neutral,0
buy it in the us right now everyone and,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
their dog has already bought one made,0.0,Neutral,0
their reviews and then probably returned,0.0,Neutral,0
it as well so i'm a little late to the,-0.24375,Negative,0
party but i'm here with my vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
and with my considerably lighter,0.1,Positive,1
music,0.0,Neutral,0
"wallet this is 3,500 before tax and i",0.0,Neutral,0
didn't know better so i also expect the,0.5,Positive,1
higher 512 gig version which was even,0.25,Positive,1
more expensive and i even bought myself,0.0,Neutral,0
the nasa style apple protective case,0.0,Neutral,0
which is absolutely massive by the way,0.0,Neutral,0
and if you do plan to take this,0.0,Neutral,0
traveling with you you know watch a,0.0,Neutral,0
movie on the plane then bear in mind,0.0,Neutral,0
that this is probably going to take up,0.0,Neutral,0
about half of your backpack oh and also,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
because i did ship this from the the us,0.0,Neutral,0
uh the us customs people decided it,0.0,Neutral,0
would be uh fun to actually slice open,0.09999999999999999,Positive,1
the case,0.0,Neutral,0
there but anyway what's it actually been,0.0,Neutral,0
like using in the uk and wearing it,0.0,Neutral,0
every day here at home at the office,0.0,Neutral,0
which actually is for me the same thing,0.0,Neutral,0
but also out and about looking like a,0.0,Neutral,0
complete knob has the novelty worn off,0.1,Positive,1
and should you actually consider buying,0.0,Neutral,0
one of these when you eventually can,0.0,Neutral,0
well the very first thing you need to,0.325,Positive,1
know if you're not from the land of the,0.0,Neutral,0
brave and home of the fre and all that,0.8,Positive,1
you can't actually use the app store it,0.0,Neutral,0
says not available in your country which,-0.2,Negative,0
is kind of a big problem fortunately i,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
thought ahead 3 years ahead in,0.0,Neutral,0
preparation just for this review and i,0.0,Neutral,0
actually married an american woman uh,0.125,Positive,1
and then i thought well i'll just use,0.0,Neutral,0
her apple id but turns out she's team,0.0,Neutral,0
pixel she doesn't actually have an apple,0.0,Neutral,0
id but my brother-in-law who's also,0.0,Neutral,0
american does i managed to go into the,0.0,Neutral,0
app store and media purchasing settings,0.0,Neutral,0
menu and change it to his apple id so if,0.0,Neutral,0
you do decide to import one of these,0.0,Neutral,0
before they launch glob later this year,0.0,Neutral,0
you will need an apple id registered to,0.0,Neutral,0
a us phone number bit of a faf and,0.0,Neutral,0
obviously you also can't exactly return,0.125,Positive,1
it very easily but once i was up and,0.5633333333333334,Positive,1
running holy moly it's not very often a,-0.1,Negative,0
new piece of tech genuinely leaves me,0.2681818181818182,Positive,1
speechless is the most ridiculously,0.08333333333333334,Positive,1
futuristic,0.0,Neutral,0
thing i think i've seen in a long time,-0.05,Negative,0
there's been times this has felt like,0.0,Neutral,0
magic and more importantly giving me,0.4666666666666666,Positive,1

always dreamed of literally dragging,0.0,Neutral,0
windows around scrubbing through videos,0.0,Neutral,0
with your hands watching spatial videos,0.0,Neutral,0
in this ethereal mist i guess we'll call,0.0,Neutral,0
it got to keep,0.0,Neutral,0
running although i promise i'm not,0.0,Neutral,0
planning any murders at least not yet,-0.3,Negative,0
danny whit twe for the fed oops maybe,0.0,Neutral,0
there is one person like murder seems a,0.0,Neutral,0
bit harsh but whoever designed the light,0.1,Positive,1
seal the light blocker uh the magnet guy,0.4,Positive,1
because at least once a day i pick this,-0.3,Negative,0
up by the light seal which is not strong,0.09166666666666669,Positive,1
enough do not pick it up by the light,0.2,Positive,1
seal which is tricky because then you,0.0,Neutral,0
get your mucky porw prints all over the,0.0,Neutral,0
front and it just looks like something,0.0,Neutral,0
you should be able to pick it up from,0.5,Positive,1
but it is not strong enough so hopefully,-0.10833333333333332,Negative,0
apple in the next version in a million,0.0,Neutral,0
years can maybe make this a bit stronger,0.0,Neutral,0
because right now like every day i'm,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
almost breaking this but murdering aside,0.0,Neutral,0
this thing is so freaking cool all you,0.35,Positive,1
want to do is open up apps for the hell,0.0,Neutral,0
of it just to move them around and,0.0,Neutral,0
create your own little over-the-top,-0.029166666666666674,Negative,0
multitasking setup with every app in a,0.0,Neutral,0
window floating around you and of course,0.0,Neutral,0
you're going to want to fire up your,0.0,Neutral,0
go-to show off a new tv movie we all,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
have those right benchmark show or movie,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
that you just want to see how much,0.2,Positive,1
better it looks on that for me it's,0.5,Positive,1
always been dark knight and banded,-0.075,Negative,0
brothers more recently uh masters of the,0.25,Positive,1
air which is actually like the new,0.06818181818181818,Positive,1
version of bandon brothers and also,0.0,Neutral,0
rogue one i also did actually buy uh,0.0,Neutral,0
avatar 2 in 3d on this just to try out,0.0,Neutral,0
3d because you can watch 3d movies,0.0,Neutral,0
although not on youtube uh and it looks,0.0,Neutral,0
good i still don't like that movie and i,0.7,Positive,1
hate how it changes the frame rate,-0.8,Negative,0
between scenes in avatar 2 but it looks,0.0,Neutral,0
really bloody good so you've got your,-0.050000000000000044,Negative,0
apple tv and your disney plus apps for,0.0,Neutral,0
now with a handful of fancy spatial,0.0,Neutral,0
vision experiences on apple store but,0.0,Neutral,0
you can also watch youtube and netflix,0.0,Neutral,0
and pretty much anything else you want,0.225,Positive,1
in safari sit back relax turn on cinema,0.0,Neutral,0
mode which puts you in this perfect seat,1.0,Positive,1
of your own empty theater you also have,0.25,Positive,1
to agree it's a damn goodl looking,0.0,Neutral,0
headset i mean ski goggle vibes for sure,0.09375,Positive,1
and it's definitely heavier than i'd,0.0,Neutral,0
like it to be but the industrial design,0.0,Neutral,0
the attention to detail i even just like,0.0,Neutral,0
having it on my desk again though don't,0.0,Neutral,0
pick it up by the light,0.4,Positive,1
seal two buttons on the headset the,0.0,Neutral,0
crown wheel which effectively acc as,0.6,Positive,1
your home button bringing up the app,0.0,Neutral,0
menu and rotating it turns up the,0.0,Neutral,0
immersive background so your real world,0.2,Positive,1
disappears the other button opens the,-0.125,Negative,0
built-in camera and acts as a shutter,0.0,Neutral,0
button one press to take a photo but the,0.0,Neutral,0
quality isn't particularly good and i,0.7,Positive,1
can't say i've ever found myself,0.0,Neutral,0
actually using the built-in camera,0.0,Neutral,0
instead of just grabbing my iphone,0.0,Neutral,0
speaking of which why the bloody hell,-0.8,Negative,0
and i feel like that was a bit of no,0.0,Neutral,0
reaction but why can't i face unlock my,0.0,Neutral,0
iphone while wearing the vision pro it's,0.0,Neutral,0
already got the optic id it knows i'm,0.0,Neutral,0
wearing it it can unlock from my watch,0.0,Neutral,0
because it knows i'm wearing it but,0.0,Neutral,0
every time i pick up my phone it's like,0.0,Neutral,0
can't see you enter your pin and even,0.0,Neutral,0
worse why unlike the mac which will come,-0.4,Negative,0
to in a second can't i also have a,0.0,Neutral,0
virtual iphone screen in my vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
headset if i could have my bunch of apps,0.0,Neutral,0
my mac my iphone screen that would be,0.0,Neutral,0
cool right so you have the headset but,0.31785714285714284,Positive,1
then you also have the power pack the,0.0,Neutral,0
battery essentially there is no battery,0.0,Neutral,0
in here you can't use it without that if,0.0,Neutral,0
you unplug from here it simply turns off,0.0,Neutral,0
and unfortunately this usbc port uh is,-0.5,Negative,0
only for charging it's an input for,0.0,Neutral,0
charging it doesn't do anything else you,0.0,Neutral,0
can't for example plug in a hard drive,-0.2916666666666667,Negative,0
or your drone or your laptop or your ps5,0.0,Neutral,0
and use this as a big screen for other,-0.0625,Negative,0
devices it doesn't work technically you,0.0,Neutral,0
can remote play from your ps5 i did get,-0.1,Negative,0
it working although there isn't the,0.0,Neutral,0
official ps5 remote play app which is,-0.1,Negative,0
available on ios and ipad os but not,0.4,Positive,1
even in the broader non-vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
category of the app store on the vision,0.0,Neutral,0
pro so you have to go through a third,0.0,Neutral,0
party and while it does technically work,0.0,Neutral,0
the compression the quality i don't,0.0,Neutral,0
particularly recommend it one quick,0.25,Positive,1
point i know a lot of people think that,0.0,Neutral,0
the only way to turn this off is by,0.0,Neutral,0
that's not the right one is by turning,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
the power cable,0.0,Neutral,0
and disconnecting like that i've now,0.0,Neutral,0
gone black essentially but there is,-0.08333333333333333,Negative,0
another way of doing it if you actually,0.0,Neutral,0
long press both these buttons it will,-0.05,Negative,0
firstly bring up a force quit app menu,0.25,Positive,1
which is very helpful if one of your,0.2,Positive,1
apps is a bit unresponsive or just a bit,0.0,Neutral,0
buggy you can force quit the app that,0.0,Neutral,0
way uh but holding it for longer brings,0.0,Neutral,0
up a traditional power off slider not,0.0,Neutral,0
just brutally disconnecting it which i,-0.875,Negative,0
suspect isn't great for the battery,0.8,Positive,1
health in the longterm but those are the,0.0,Neutral,0
only physical things you'll touch except,0.0,Neutral,0
for playing with the headband tightening,0.0,Neutral,0
wheel on the side everything else is,0.0,Neutral,0
look and pinch or press and i'm kind of,0.6,Positive,1
amazed how effortless and second nature,0.0,Neutral,0
it all feels a handful of times it's not,0.0,Neutral,0
quite highlighted what i'm looking at or,0.0,Neutral,0
the camera didn't pick up my pinch but,0.0,Neutral,0
95% of the time it works every time i've,0.0,Neutral,0
also found apples pretty bang on about,0.25,Positive,1
that 2hour battery life or up to 2 and 1,0.0,Neutral,0
half hours watching videos a couple of,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
times i've had to stop because it's run,0.0,Neutral,0
out of juice but it's not been a big,0.0,Neutral,0
problem and generally when i'm sat at my,0.05000000000000002,Positive,1
desk here i'll just plug the battery,0.0,Neutral,0
into my mac anyway to keep it topped up,0.0,Neutral,0
so it all looks and sounds spectacular,0.6,Positive,1
and speaking of which the built-in,0.0,Neutral,0
speakers are better than they have any,0.5,Positive,1
right to be in a headset their,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
size they're loud bassy you get spatial,0.1,Positive,1
audio and having sound coming from the,0.4,Positive,1
direction of the window is playing from,0.0,Neutral,0
in your 3d world really adds to that,0.2,Positive,1
immersive factor although i would say,0.0,Neutral,0
airpod pros particularly the second,0.08333333333333333,Positive,1
generation with the usbc charger port uh,0.0,Neutral,0
because spefic specifically this new,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
model does support spatial audio with,0.0,Neutral,0
the vision pro is probably your best bet,1.0,Positive,1
for getting that most immersive sort of,0.5,Positive,1
sound experience and i'm going to try,0.4,Positive,1
and avoid using the word immersive as,0.0,Neutral,0
much as possible in this review uh also,0.0,Neutral,0
take chap 2 because the first ones i,0.25,Positive,1
lost on a plane and there's the othered,0.0,Neutral,0
benefit of not annoying everyone around,0.4,Positive,1
you because there is a lot of sound leak,0.4,Positive,1
from the vision pro yeah baby the,0.0,Neutral,0
weirdest thing is i have no idea what,0.0,Neutral,0
you're,0.0,Neutral,0
doing i recently jumped on facetime call,0.0,Neutral,0
with my buddy tommy complete with our,0.1,Positive,1
creepy uncanny valley personas but the,-0.5,Negative,0
vision pro's mic quality the noise,0.0,Neutral,0
cancellation absolutely phenomenal i had,0.5,Positive,1
no idea tommy was sat in a hotel lobby,0.0,Neutral,0
although apparently the guy next to,0.025,Positive,1
tommy could hear me coming out of the,0.0,Neutral,0
headset and asked him to put headphones,0.0,Neutral,0
on but for me at least it sounded,-0.3,Negative,0
amazing but for properly escaping,0.30000000000000004,Positive,1
reality just spin this apple watch style,0.0,Neutral,0
crown on the top of few times and the,0.15,Positive,1
real world which you've been seeing,0.2,Positive,1
through the incredibly impressive pass,1.0,Positive,1
through cameras fades away into one one,0.0,Neutral,0
of these gorgeously immersive if,0.7,Positive,1
somewhat lonely environments this would,-0.09999999999999998,Negative,0
be a lot cooler if i could share it with,0.0,Neutral,0
someone and while most of my time in the,0.5,Positive,1
vision pro has felt kind of lonely you,0.25,Positive,1
do have share play and while again you,0.0,Neutral,0
can't see the film because i'm screen,0.0,Neutral,0
recording i had a lovely time watching,0.5,Positive,1
about 10 minutes or so of the creator on,0.0,Neutral,0
disney plus with aaron from mr who a,0.0,Neutral,0
boss we could both pause or fast forward,0.2,Positive,1
the film and it would syn up for the,0.0,Neutral,0
other one and it was genuinely nice to,0.2375,Positive,1
catch up and talk about the vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
and watch something with incredible,0.9,Positive,1
sound and video quality i could also,0.4,Positive,1
share my screen as i gave him a bit of a,0.0,Neutral,0
tour of the studio and as funny as these,0.25,Positive,1
personas look and to be fair his is,0.7,Positive,1
better than mine after a while you do,0.5,Positive,1
kind of get used to it the whole,0.4,Positive,1
experience was another one of those,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro magical moments until about,0.5,Positive,1
15 minutes in and we both said it was,0.0,Neutral,0
getting a little bit uncomfortable and i,-0.34375,Negative,0
really didn't fancy watching a whole,0.2,Positive,1
2hour film in this the first 48 hours,0.25,Positive,1
the first couple of days are just a,0.25,Positive,1
blissful magical time of experimenting,0.5,Positive,1
and figuring out what it can and what it,0.0,Neutral,0
can't do just messing around but then,0.0,Neutral,0
maybe like day three day four you see it,0.0,Neutral,0
sat on your desk or your coffee table or,0.0,Neutral,0
wherever and you think why why am i,0.0,Neutral,0
going to put that on now what am i,0.0,Neutral,0
actually going to use this for for me a,0.0,Neutral,0
big reason i wanted the vision pro was,0.0,Neutral,0
to use it as a big screen with my mac,0.0,Neutral,0
and it didn't disappoint well at least,-0.3,Negative,0
not at first just tap or do the pinchy,0.25,Positive,1
gesture on this connect button that pops,0.0,Neutral,0
up above your laptop and as the macbook,0.0,Neutral,0
screen turns off a giant virtual screen,0.0,Neutral,0
appears in the headset you can move it,0.0,Neutral,0
around in your 3d space you can resize,0.0,Neutral,0
it and of course you can open other,-0.0625,Negative,0
vision pro apps next to it but then you,0.0,Neutral,0
start to see the shortcomings for one,0.0,Neutral,0
you have to keep reminding yourself that,0.0,Neutral,0
you are working in two different,0.0,Neutral,0
operating systems and while you can,0.0,Neutral,0
airdrop and use icloud you can't look,0.0,Neutral,0
and pinch and gesture to control your,0.0,Neutral,0
laptop and you're also limited to one,-0.07142857142857142,Negative,0
screen yes it can be a giant screen so,0.0,Neutral,0
obviously you've got more space for,0.25,Positive,1
having apps side by side but it does,0.0,Neutral,0
feel limiting especially if you're used,0.0,Neutral,0
to having a second monitor i tend to use,0.0,Neutral,0
the apple studio display here on my desk,0.0,Neutral,0
plugged into my macbook and i can tell,0.0,Neutral,0
you that the vision pro is not as sharp,-0.125,Negative,0
it's close it will be better than a ttp,0.5,Positive,1
27in monitor but it's not the same and,0.0,Neutral,0
because of the fiated rendering which,0.0,Neutral,0
prioritizes the quality of what you're,0.0,Neutral,0
directly looking at everything around,0.1,Positive,1
that your periphery looks kind of out of,0.6,Positive,1
focus and fuzzy and you'd better make,0.5,Positive,1
sure that you can touch type if you turn,0.5,Positive,1
the immersive background all the way up,0.0,Neutral,0
and the laptop disappears and while for,0.0,Neutral,0
a good 20 minutes or so i was working,0.7,Positive,1
away i then started to feel the weight,0.0,Neutral,0
on my face on my nose my eyes started,0.0,Neutral,0
feeling a bit strained and as magical as,0.5,Positive,1
it seems at first it's just not as,0.25,Positive,1
comfortable as my current setup but wait,0.2,Positive,1
tom hold your horses obviously you've,0.0,Neutral,0
got a nice setup here maybe you could,0.6,Positive,1
use it on the go you're absolutely right,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
i thought that as well so i took it on,0.0,Neutral,0
the train with me and sure enough a big,0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
effing virtual screen beats hunching,-0.5,Negative,0
over my 16-in macbook pro on the train,0.0,Neutral,0
no one can see my screen and as i put it,0.0,Neutral,0
on the headset turns on travel mode so,0.0,Neutral,0
the screens aren't constantly flying,0.0,Neutral,0
away from me so i carried on watching a,0.0,Neutral,0
youtube video in one window and writing,0.0,Neutral,0
this review in another and that lasted,0.0,Neutral,0
for about 2 minutes because i quickly,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
realized the movement of the train was,0.0,Neutral,0
giving me a constant motion blur it's,0.0,Neutral,0
subtle not enough to bother me if i was,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
maybe watching a film but my google doc,0.0,Neutral,0
the websites i was reading the text all,0.0,Neutral,0
became nauseatingly fuzzy so my initial,0.0,Neutral,0
excitement of using the vision pro with,0.0,Neutral,0
my mac quickly turned to frustration and,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
for me a better solution would just,0.5,Positive,1
plugging in a pair of xreal air2 pros,0.0,Neutral,0
far more comfortable it does a similar,0.25,Positive,1
job in many ways with its microed,0.5,Positive,1
screens and you can have your big laptop,0.0,Neutral,0
screen projected in front of you and it,0.0,Neutral,0
"is also 33,000 cheaper so now i'm",0.0,Neutral,0
scratching my head literally because the,0.0,Neutral,0
headband has messed up my hair and if,0.0,Neutral,0
you are partial to a bit of makeup on,-0.1,Negative,0
your face i suspect you'll come out with,0.0,Neutral,0
a few smudges and a nicely stained light,0.26666666666666666,Positive,1
seal could i use it for fitness for,0.0,Neutral,0
working out well maybe and i have and i,0.0,Neutral,0
have to admit it was pretty cool being,0.3,Positive,1
able to work out in front of a mirror,0.5,Positive,1
i've got a youtube video i'm following,0.0,Neutral,0
along to one side i could have my,0.0,Neutral,0
fitness goals or a tracker or whatever,0.0,Neutral,0
app i like on another side it does work,0.0,Neutral,0
but after maybe 5 or 10 minutes it feels,0.0,Neutral,0
heavy you'll get sweaty and also you,-0.2,Negative,0
have to find somewhere for the battery,0.0,Neutral,0
pack to go maybe if there were some cool,0.35,Positive,1
ar features that popped up to track your,0.0,Neutral,0
workout or paired with your apple watch,0.0,Neutral,0
it could monitor your health on screen i,0.0,Neutral,0
would love that but no the vast majority,0.25,Positive,1
of apps just open in a window and don't,0.0,Neutral,0
do anything special but at the end of,0.35714285714285715,Positive,1
the day you just have a bunch of virtual,0.0,Neutral,0
screens plonked around you nothing,0.0,Neutral,0
interacts with the real world as for,0.2,Positive,1
gaming well you've got apple arcade you,0.0,Neutral,0
can pair a controller and there's a,0.0,Neutral,0
handful of genuinely fun stuff synth,0.3,Positive,1
riders for example is basically your,0.0,Neutral,0
beat saber and it's a lot of fun,0.3,Positive,1
although you might get a few looks if,-0.2,Negative,0
you play this,0.0,Neutral,0
outside and there's some fantastic apps,0.2,Positive,1
building lego having t-rexes come out at,0.0,Neutral,0
you in,0.0,Neutral,0
3d there's a lot of what feels like good,0.7,Positive,1
tech demos and of course anything that,0.0,Neutral,0
you can can run or play on your mac you,0.0,Neutral,0
can also have on the big screen here but,0.0,Neutral,0
there's no wreck room there's no,0.0,Neutral,0
halflife alex or super hot or arizona,0.29166666666666663,Positive,1
sunshine for the best vr gaming get,1.0,Positive,1
yourself a quest 3 or a psvr 2 and then,0.0,Neutral,0
maybe use the three grand you've saved,0.5,Positive,1
on a nice holiday you deserve it i also,0.6,Positive,1
know a lot of businesses and even,0.0,Neutral,0
schools were excited to invest in these,0.375,Positive,1
for designing visualizing prototypes,0.0,Neutral,0
pitching clients teaching but and,0.0,Neutral,0
there's always a butt it seems there's,0.0,Neutral,0
just no really easy way to actually,-0.10833333333333334,Negative,0
share the experience because simply,0.0,Neutral,0
handing the headset over to someone else,0.0,Neutral,0
it might not fit their head properly the,-0.1,Negative,0
light seal may be uncomfortable or not,-0.04999999999999999,Negative,0
give the best experience they have to go,1.0,Positive,1
through this optical eye setup each time,0.0,Neutral,0
which to be fair is handy for people,0.6499999999999999,Positive,1
learning how to actually look and pinch,0.0,Neutral,0
and use it but it's a pain having to do,0.0,Neutral,0
it every time and there's just no way of,0.0,Neutral,0
sharing the experience with someone,0.0,Neutral,0
outside of mirroring to your tv or,0.0,Neutral,0
screen so they can see what you see so,0.0,Neutral,0
you kind of get the idea here i'm,0.6,Positive,1
mirroring my vision pro to my mac studio,0.0,Neutral,0
which is plugged into the apple studio,0.0,Neutral,0
display so it might look a little bit,-0.1875,Negative,0
bit disorienting for you but you can see,0.0,Neutral,0
roughly what i can see however anyone,-0.1,Negative,0
looking at this because of that phobia,0.0,Neutral,0
rendering a lot of it will look a little,-0.1875,Negative,0
bit blurry except for what my eyes are,0.0,Neutral,0
actually focused on so my waffly,0.0,Neutral,0
slightly ranty point being it's fun but,0.06666666666666667,Positive,1
it doesn't solve any problem i don't,0.0,Neutral,0
really know why i'd want to use it like,0.2,Positive,1
this there's also no window management,0.0,Neutral,0
to speak of by the way and i wish there,0.0,Neutral,0
was a way of saving your window setup,0.0,Neutral,0
for a particular place like the office,0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
or your living room so you could then,0.0,Neutral,0
jump right back in without opening and,0.14285714285714285,Positive,1
placing them all again however with all,0.0,Neutral,0
that said it is the first generation of,0.25,Positive,1
a whole new product category for apple,0.16818181818181818,Positive,1
and of course the meta quest 3 has more,0.5,Positive,1
apps and vr experiences and of course,0.0,Neutral,0
it's cheaper they've been doing it for,0.0,Neutral,0
years and they're going after a,0.0,Neutral,0
different audience developers need time,0.0,Neutral,0
to build amazing experiences for the,0.6000000000000001,Positive,1
vision pro and it is the vision pro and,0.0,Neutral,0
"for 3,500 it does feel a little bit",-0.1875,Negative,0
like a developer kit and to give you an,0.0,Neutral,0
idea i could buy a macbook pro m3 14in,0.0,Neutral,0
an iphone 15 pro and a ipad pro m2 for,0.0,Neutral,0
the same price near enough as the vision,0.03333333333333333,Positive,1
pro right before i wrap this waffle,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
review up a couple of things to mention,0.0,Neutral,0
i don't see any good reason to pay extra,0.35,Positive,1
for the 512 or higher capacity versions,0.25,Positive,1
of the vision pro there's really nothing,0.2,Positive,1
that takes up that much storage and,0.2,Positive,1
anything huge you'll probably have on,0.4000000000000001,Positive,1
your laptop or your iphone or in the,0.0,Neutral,0
icloud anyway so if you do buy one of,0.0,Neutral,0
these i would just stick with the base,-0.8,Negative,0
storage and not pay the extra also don't,0.0,Neutral,0
pay too 0000 for this it's massive it,0.0,Neutral,0
tears fairly easily or at least it does,-0.3,Negative,0
if it goes through us customs and there,0.0,Neutral,0
are some great third party cases and,0.4,Positive,1
accessories uh that are so much cheaper,0.2,Positive,1
now as well so definitely have a look,0.0,Neutral,0
elsewhere first you do also have two,0.25,Positive,1
headband options in the box uh one of,0.0,Neutral,0
which has a second over the head strap,0.0,Neutral,0
which obviously ruins your hair even,-0.15,Negative,0
more than this does and it does take a,0.5,Positive,1
little bit of the weight off your face,-0.1875,Negative,0
and your nose but genuinely i found,0.4,Positive,1
myself using this one most of the time,0.5,Positive,1
and you can disassemble it like you see,0.0,Neutral,0
there the light seal comes off nice and,0.5,Positive,1
easily you can also pull this orange tab,0.43333333333333335,Positive,1
to take this band off you can unplug the,0.0,Neutral,0
actual headset and so it sort of comes,0.0,Neutral,0
down to that size i also have to say,-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
after using it for maybe 20 to 30,0.0,Neutral,0
minutes while it's not super,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
uncomfortable when i take it off my eyes,-0.5,Negative,0
feel strained i've got marks around it a,0.0,Neutral,0
little,-0.1875,Negative,0
bit you never come out of this feeling,0.0,Neutral,0
fresh and if you're at the office if,0.3,Positive,1
you're going out afterwards if you're,0.0,Neutral,0
with people around you it's not the,0.0,Neutral,0
nicest experience obviously no vr,0.0,Neutral,0

can feel a little bit tunnel vision,-0.1875,Negative,0
sometimes and as i say the lack of a,0.0,Neutral,0

the first app i'm seeing how you control,0.25,Positive,1
the vision pro is simply by looking at,0.0,Neutral,0
something and pinching with your fingers,0.0,Neutral,0
which is as you can see i'm like going,0.0,Neutral,0
up and down my fingers and it's just,-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
tracking it like that's so crazy okay so,-0.04999999999999999,Negative,0

hello everyone i'm thrilled to present,0.3,Positive,1
our comprehensive review of the apple,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro we'll cover its standout,0.0,Neutral,0
features performance user experience and,0.0,Neutral,0
most importantly answer the burning,0.45,Positive,1
question is it worth your hard earned,0.004166666666666652,Positive,1
money so without further ado let's dive,0.0,Neutral,0
into the video and don't forget to hit,0.0,Neutral,0
the like button and subscribe to the,0.0,Neutral,0
channel apple announced a new computer,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
last week to great fanfare the vision,0.4,Positive,1
pro is a computer that is worn on your,0.0,Neutral,0
face but the novel aspect is how you use,0.0,Neutral,0
it rather than view the computer's,0.0,Neutral,0
output through a physical screen that,0.0,Neutral,0
output is projected directly into your,0.1,Positive,1
eyes with two very small but high,-0.0825,Negative,0
resolution displays a very small,-0.325,Negative,0
distance in front of you rather than,0.0,Neutral,0
control the computer through a keyboard,0.0,Neutral,0
mouse or touchscreen the primary user,0.4,Positive,1
interface is through eye tracking and,0.0,Neutral,0
gestures just as they remove the stylus,0.0,Neutral,0
for screens when they launched the,0.0,Neutral,0
iphone apple requires no physical,0.0,Neutral,0
controller to use the computer the,0.0,Neutral,0
computer senses what you are interested,0.25,Positive,1
in interacting with by watching your eye,0.0,Neutral,0
movement and then looks at your hands to,0.0,Neutral,0
determine what you want to do there have,0.0,Neutral,0
been antecedants to each of these things,0.0,Neutral,0
a myriad of worn devices for viewing,0.0,Neutral,0
such as the google glass or meta's quest,0.0,Neutral,0
pro and technologies such as leap motion,0.0,Neutral,0
and the muu arm bound for gesture,0.0,Neutral,0
control but none of these predat,0.0,Neutral,0
pressors put it all together as a,0.0,Neutral,0
coherent vision apple has turned this,0.5,Positive,1
new device a spatial computer the name,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
is apt because the device can use any,0.6,Positive,1
physical space around you as a canvas to,0.0,Neutral,0
display digital outputs there is no need,0.0,Neutral,0
for a desk or lap to place the device,0.0,Neutral,0
and there are no limits on the size of,0.0,Neutral,0
the perceived viewing area that means,0.0,Neutral,0
you could technically sit in a small,-0.125,Negative,0
space like an airplane seat and watch a,0.0,Neutral,0
cinema sized movie what should you be,0.0,Neutral,0
aiming to do with a spatial computer,0.0,Neutral,0
right now apple has outlined use cases,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
that seem pedestrian you can use it like,0.0,Neutral,0
a normal computer or ipad but with the,0.15,Positive,1
current 2d information presented on a,0.0,Neutral,0
much more flexible and unconstrained,0.5,Positive,1
display there's demand for that it will,0.0,Neutral,0
be of value where you do not have much,0.2,Positive,1
space and it will be of value to those,0.0,Neutral,0
who currently use their space with a,0.0,Neutral,0
host of large displays in that sense the,0.21428571428571427,Positive,1
closest analog log is a very large,0.2785714285714286,Positive,1
screen tv would people pay,0.0,Neutral,0
"3,500 for that they do right now even",0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
apple sells a display the pro display xd,0.0,Neutral,0
that can cost up to,0.0,Neutral,0
"6,000 from that perspective it is",0.0,Neutral,0
easily in the cost pllp park for current,0.21666666666666667,Positive,1
use cases this strategy also has the,0.0,Neutral,0
benefit of seeding this new platform,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
with the vast number of applications,0.0,Neutral,0
that already exist for the ipad and the,0.0,Neutral,0
iphone phone a better and more,0.5,Positive,1
convenient display for 2d content,0.0,Neutral,0
however does not appear to justify the,0.0,Neutral,0
technological and r and dweight that has,0.0,Neutral,0
gone into the vision pro the real,0.2,Positive,1
question is whether this device can lead,0.0,Neutral,0
to the augmented and virtual reality,0.0,Neutral,0
applications that would justify,0.0,Neutral,0
strapping a computer to your head it,0.0,Neutral,0
certainly has the technical capabilities,0.10714285714285714,Positive,1
to do so the vision pro can display 3d,0.0,Neutral,0
objects in your current space or even,0.0,Neutral,0
transport you to new spaces apple,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
however barely mentioned the terms ar,0.05,Positive,1
and vr during their,0.0,Neutral,0
announcement in doing so they drew a,0.0,Neutral,0
line people have not drawn before this,0.0,Neutral,0
is no ar or vr device or technology the,0.0,Neutral,0
technology is a spatial computer and if,0.0,Neutral,0
there is a role for ar and vr it is in,0.0,Neutral,0
applications that run on a spatial,0.0,Neutral,0
computer let's review those concepts,0.0,Neutral,0
augmented reality involves taking the,0.0,Neutral,0
environment around you and changing your,0.0,Neutral,0
perception of it google glass did this,0.0,Neutral,0
by showing you notifications via smart,0.21428571428571427,Positive,1
glasses the vision pro does this by,0.0,Neutral,0
placing 2d displays in that environment,0.0,Neutral,0
and fixing them so that when your head,0.0,Neutral,0
moves the display does not it appears to,0.0,Neutral,0
be there in your current,0.0,Neutral,0
environment this is achieved by passing,0.0,Neutral,0
a very accurate video of the real world,0.3600000000000001,Positive,1
through the device to you you don't see,0.0,Neutral,0
your environment directly but you think,0.1,Positive,1
you are doing so thus technically apple,0.0,Neutral,0
is augmenting a video capture of your,0.0,Neutral,0
environment not overlaying things on,0.0,Neutral,0
your direct viewing of it to a user,0.1,Positive,1
there's no real difference virtual,-0.1,Negative,0
reality involves taking the user and,0.0,Neutral,0
immersing them in a virtual environment,0.0,Neutral,0
the vision pro captures the full,0.35,Positive,1
attention of your eye and so you are by,0.0,Neutral,0
definition immersed in a virtual,0.0,Neutral,0
environment in one mode that looks like,0.0,Neutral,0
the environment you are actually in turn,0.0,Neutral,0
the dial and that can change and you can,0.0,Neutral,0
be transported somewhere else the video,0.0,Neutral,0
pass through from your current,0.0,Neutral,0
environment is replaced by a digitally,0.0,Neutral,0
created 3d environment from that,0.0,Neutral,0
perspective this is clearly a vr device,0.10000000000000002,Positive,1
the important thing to note is that,0.4,Positive,1
despite being capable of ar and vr these,0.2,Positive,1
use cases were not emphasized by apple,0.0,Neutral,0
thus they have produced a device capable,0.2,Positive,1
of both but have not found compelling,0.3,Positive,1
use cases in either,0.0,Neutral,0
domain this is one of the reasons that,0.0,Neutral,0
they announced it at their annual,0.0,Neutral,0
developer conference apple needs apps,0.0,Neutral,0
and they need other people to imagine,-0.125,Negative,0
them in a recent paper we outlined what,0.0,Neutral,0
we believe were the ways that ar and vr,0.0,Neutral,0
apps could add unique value beyond,0.375,Positive,1
gaming and entertainment our focus is on,0.0,Neutral,0
economic uses specifically those that,0.2,Positive,1
would increase users,0.0,Neutral,0
productivity in this respect we ask,0.0,Neutral,0
which a and vr applications can create,0.0,Neutral,0
real value by assisting users in making,0.2,Positive,1
better,0.5,Positive,1
decisions for someone looking to build,0.0,Neutral,0
applications for the platform apple has,0.0,Neutral,0
created understanding the possibilities,0.0,Neutral,0
is crucial decisions often involve,0.0,Neutral,0
uncertainty and having the right,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
information can reduce errors o and vr,0.0,Neutral,0
can help in this regard vr can provide,0.0,Neutral,0
more relevant information by immersing,0.45,Positive,1
users in contexts such as simulating,0.0,Neutral,0
dangerous situations for training ir on,-0.6,Negative,0
the other hand can pass information in a,-0.125,Negative,0
given context to provide relevant,0.4,Positive,1
details like identifying people or,0.0,Neutral,0
showing exit routes however the vision,0.0,Neutral,0
pro is not designed for use outside of,0.0,Neutral,0
controlled environments like homes or,0.0,Neutral,0
workplaces limiting its use in,0.0,Neutral,0
navigating external,0.0,Neutral,0
environments this perspective suggests,0.0,Neutral,0
that many previous ar and vr use cases,0.16666666666666669,Positive,1
have been of low value vr meetings with,0.0,Neutral,0
avatars and ar glasses with text,0.0,Neutral,0
notifications may not offer,0.0,Neutral,0
significantly better information than,0.5,Positive,1
traditional methods like zoom calls the,0.0,Neutral,0
best use cases for ar and vr are in,1.0,Positive,1
contexts where getting information is,0.0,Neutral,0
expensive or dangerous or where digital,-0.3666666666666667,Negative,0
overlays can simplify complex,-0.3,Negative,0
environments examples include,0.0,Neutral,0
prototyping aircraft designs or,0.0,Neutral,0
assisting in remote medical,-0.05,Negative,0
procedures developers should focus on,0.0,Neutral,0
creating applications that provide users,0.0,Neutral,0
with hard to access contextual,-0.2916666666666667,Negative,0
information at the right level of,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
detail apple's vision pro has the,0.0,Neutral,0
capabilities for these tasks but the job,0.0,Neutral,0
will experimenting and designing for,0.0,Neutral,0
these use cases has been left to others,0.0,Neutral,0
this pattern is typical for apple where,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
devices evolve beyond their initial use,0.0,Neutral,0
through developer,0.0,Neutral,0
innovation so this wraps up our in-depth,0.0,Neutral,0

applause,0.0,Neutral,0
music,0.0,Neutral,0
all right so it's been roughly 90 days,0.09285714285714285,Positive,1
since i bought this the apple vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
it's my most expensive apple product,0.0,Neutral,0
ever but was it worth it absolutely,0.25,Positive,1
but does it have some things that it,0.0,Neutral,0
actually needs to,0.0,Neutral,0
improve,0.0,Neutral,0
absolutely all right so it's no secret,0.22857142857142856,Positive,1
that the hype for the apple vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
has cooled off a little bit this was,-0.1875,Negative,0
actually a new category for apple a,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
whole new product almost a whole new,0.16818181818181818,Positive,1
genre of headsets so yes it is something,0.0,Neutral,0
that was going to generate hype but now,0.0,Neutral,0
that people have it in their hands,0.0,Neutral,0
they're able to use it get used to the,0.5,Positive,1
new technology the hype has died down a,-0.009595959595959616,Negative,0
little bit and there are some things,-0.1875,Negative,0
that apple 100% needs to actually build,0.0,Neutral,0
on for it to be actually take off to,0.0,Neutral,0
another level same thing with the iphone,0.0,Neutral,0
at first it was cool everyone talked,0.3,Positive,1
about it it was crazy at first but then,-0.175,Negative,0
when got in people hands i mean they,-0.3125,Negative,0
were still amazed with the technology,0.0,Neutral,0
but they were only left with what can,0.0,Neutral,0
apple do to improve this to actually,0.0,Neutral,0
make it worldwide and more accessible,0.4375,Positive,1
and that's what i want to talk about,0.0,Neutral,0
because don't don't get me wrong the,-0.5,Negative,0
apple vision pro is probably the best,1.0,Positive,1
tech device that i've purchased in a,0.0,Neutral,0
very very long time i actually want to,-0.0325,Negative,0
see it grow i actually want to see more,0.25,Positive,1
and more people use it i think the only,0.25,Positive,1
thing that's stopping people from,0.0,Neutral,0
getting this is simply the price i don't,0.0,Neutral,0
think that apple is actually worried,0.0,Neutral,0
about the price right now they're just,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
worried about making the technology,0.0,Neutral,0
actually good so yeah that's what we're,0.7,Positive,1
going to talk about right now how can,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
apple improve the apple vision pro and,0.0,Neutral,0
make it more accessible more fun to use,0.41875,Positive,1
and just a better device in,0.5,Positive,1
music,0.0,Neutral,0
general the first thing i want to talk,0.15000000000000002,Positive,1
about in regards to the apple vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
that apple might need to fix change or,0.0,Neutral,0
improve is the environments hear me out,0.0,Neutral,0
i know that apple has very good looking,0.9099999999999999,Positive,1
environments my favorite is the halala i,0.5,Positive,1
think that's how you pronounce it and,0.0,Neutral,0
the joshua tree and the mount hood those,0.0,Neutral,0
are my favorite environments but apple,0.5,Positive,1
needs more i feel like the environments,0.5,Positive,1
should be like your wallpapers for your,0.0,Neutral,0
phone it's one of the best features with,1.0,Positive,1
the apple vision pro and i love to be in,0.5,Positive,1
an environment but the issue here is,0.0,Neutral,0
that the only environments that are,0.0,Neutral,0
available are the ones that apple,0.4,Positive,1
decides to be available and and this is,0.4,Positive,1
the same problem that we have with the,0.0,Neutral,0
apple watch the apple watch has watch,0.0,Neutral,0
faces that you can put on your watch and,0.0,Neutral,0
you can have different types of watch,0.0,Neutral,0
faces but it's fairly simple or very,0.1,Positive,1
easy to make watch faces so apple can,0.43333333333333335,Positive,1
come out with a bunch of them every time,0.0,Neutral,0
they want so apple might not feel the,0.0,Neutral,0
need to have watch faces be available,0.4,Positive,1
for third party and third party vendors,0.0,Neutral,0
to make and sell was faces sure you can,0.5,Positive,1
have certain environments within certain,0.21428571428571427,Positive,1
apps like for example disney plus you,0.0,Neutral,0
can be on tatooine you can be on monster,0.0,Neutral,0
inc uh i think the monster inc facility,0.0,Neutral,0
but you can only use those environments,0.0,Neutral,0
within those apps and you can't actually,0.0,Neutral,0
purchase them third party and use other,-0.0625,Negative,0
apps with those environments so i would,0.0,Neutral,0
actually suggest that apple has a,0.0,Neutral,0
section in the app store that allows you,0.0,Neutral,0
to purchase certain environments so if i,0.21428571428571427,Positive,1
want to be in tatooine but don't want to,0.0,Neutral,0
use disney plus and just want to be in,0.0,Neutral,0
that environment then disney should be,0.0,Neutral,0
able to sell it and i should be able to,0.5,Positive,1
buy it so i can use other apps in that,-0.125,Negative,0
environment but right now it looks like,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
you can only use third party,0.0,Neutral,0
environments within certain apps but,0.21428571428571427,Positive,1
only apple's environments allow you to,0.0,Neutral,0
use different apps and i think that's a,0.0,Neutral,0
mistake i think apple should open up,0.0,Neutral,0
environments and they should really be,0.2,Positive,1
like the wallpaper to your apple vision,0.0,Neutral,0
pro because the world is technically,0.0,Neutral,0
your orer with the apple vision pro and,0.0,Neutral,0
the environments are technically your,0.0,Neutral,0
wallpapers so apple open up the,0.0,Neutral,0
environments make it more accessible,0.4375,Positive,1
make it cross app compatible and this is,0.0,Neutral,0
going to change the game because i love,0.04999999999999999,Positive,1
to be an environment but if we could,0.0,Neutral,0
have multiple environments available to,0.2,Positive,1
us that would be,0.0,Neutral,0
amazing all right so one thing that i,0.4428571428571429,Positive,1
mentioned earlier was for apple to have,0.0,Neutral,0
a place for the environments to be,0.0,Neutral,0
available on the app store for us to buy,0.4,Positive,1
or download,0.0,Neutral,0
and that's my next point is that the app,0.0,Neutral,0
store for the apple vision pro is,0.0,Neutral,0
absolutely horrible i mean i barely want,-0.42083333333333334,Negative,0
to use the app store even if there's an,0.0,Neutral,0
app i know i need or want to download i,0.0,Neutral,0
just dread going through the app store,0.0,Neutral,0
first of all there's only three sections,0.125,Positive,1
the first section is just a apple,0.25,Positive,1
curated app list i know that the apps,0.0,Neutral,0
for the apple vision pro are limited,-0.07142857142857142,Negative,0
because it's a new product but still,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
just have different sections apple just,0.0,Neutral,0
has one curated section for all apps and,0.0,Neutral,0
within that curated section you're going,0.0,Neutral,0
to dig through different categories of,0.0,Neutral,0
apps the other section is a specifically,-0.125,Negative,0
an apple arcade section which is all the,0.0,Neutral,0
apps or all the games for the apple,0.0,Neutral,0
arcade but no other section just for,0.0625,Positive,1
games general no non-apple arcade games,0.05000000000000002,Positive,1
all of them are all apple arcade and the,0.0,Neutral,0
third section is just a search so if you,0.0,Neutral,0
just want to browse through certain apps,0.21428571428571427,Positive,1
and if apple does doesn't curated or if,0.0,Neutral,0
it's not an apple arcade you're not,0.0,Neutral,0
going to see it you're going to have to,0.0,Neutral,0
actually search for it and you're going,0.0,Neutral,0
to need to know what exactly you're,0.25,Positive,1
looking for contrary to the iphone app,0.0,Neutral,0
store or the apple watch app store it's,0.0,Neutral,0
very easy to find a lot of different,0.2816666666666667,Positive,1
apps because it's categorized in,0.0,Neutral,0
different sections different categories,0.0,Neutral,0
different type of apps the hot app of,0.125,Positive,1
the week maybe a list of top downloaded,0.5,Positive,1
apps the most popular apps all those,0.55,Positive,1
different things are available on all,0.2,Positive,1
those different app stores but for the,0.0,Neutral,0
apple vision pro it's really hard to,-0.2916666666666667,Negative,0
find new apps unless apple wants you to,0.16818181818181818,Positive,1
see that app apple wants you to see,0.2,Positive,1
whatever new app is available trust me,0.2681818181818182,Positive,1
you are going to see it then if you have,0.0,Neutral,0
an app that you know you want to,0.0,Neutral,0
download and apple is not really,-0.1,Negative,0
promoting it you're going to have to,0.0,Neutral,0
search it yourself and even that,0.0,Neutral,0
sometimes is hard is a challenge so i,-0.2916666666666667,Negative,0
would want apple to actually revamp the,0.0,Neutral,0
whole app store i know it's new i know,0.16818181818181818,Positive,1
it's just been 3 months with the app,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro but please the app story,0.0,Neutral,0
should have been a big priority and i,0.0,Neutral,0
feel like apple dropped the ball with,0.0,Neutral,0
this one it was very very last minute,0.0,Neutral,0
literally only three sections and one of,0.0,Neutral,0
those sections are useless if you do not,-0.5,Negative,0
have apple arcade so yes apple please,0.0,Neutral,0
fix the app store and stop promoting,0.0,Neutral,0
boring random apps i mean the apple,-0.6041666666666666,Negative,0
vision pro is new but there's a lot of,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
boring stupid apps right now and apple,-0.5047619047619047,Negative,0
are promoting those apps so so i think,0.0,Neutral,0
that they should really stop revamp the,0.2,Positive,1
app store have new apps and try and put,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
those app in those respective categories,0.0,Neutral,0
but yeah right now the app store is,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
absolutely,0.2,Positive,1
horrible all right so the next part of,-0.2380952380952381,Negative,0
my wish list has to do a little bit more,0.15625,Positive,1
with gaming so i did talk about how,0.0,Neutral,0
apple has a whole section in the app,0.2,Positive,1
store dedicated for the apple arcade,0.0,Neutral,0
games but there's a piece missing here,-0.2,Negative,0
so the apple arcade games have mixed,0.0,Neutral,0
reality games where you can play in your,0.0,Neutral,0
real environment they also have 2d games,0.2,Positive,1
where you can put a big screen up in the,0.0,Neutral,0
air and just play your game like that,-0.4,Negative,0
but the only thing missing now is,-0.1,Negative,0
virtual reality games i know apple,0.0,Neutral,0
doesn't market this as a virtual reality,0.0,Neutral,0
headset they more so market this as a a,0.5,Positive,1
spatial computer but the spatial,0.0,Neutral,0
computer has virtual reality aspects i,0.0,Neutral,0
mean when you're in environment you are,-0.3125,Negative,0
in a virtual reality world so the fact,0.0,Neutral,0
that virtual reality games should be on,0.0,Neutral,0
the apple vision pro isn't much of a,0.2,Positive,1
stretch i mean have apps be able to be,0.09375,Positive,1
downloaded on the app store natively,0.0,Neutral,0
would be amazing i mean it would be easy,0.2402777777777778,Positive,1
for people to download real environment,0.2,Positive,1
environmental apps it would be a good,0.7,Positive,1
tech demo the apple vision pro has two,0.0,Neutral,0
4k screens one on each eye you can have,0.0,Neutral,0
the crispier virtual reality games the,0.0,Neutral,0
better looking the better feeling the,0.5,Positive,1
better moving virtual reality games so i,0.5,Positive,1
don't know why apple isn't really,0.2,Positive,1
focusing on having virtual reality games,0.0,Neutral,0
available on the app store and i do know,0.4,Positive,1
that there are different workarounds to,0.0,Neutral,0
download virtual reality games on the,0.0,Neutral,0
apple vision pro i wanted to be very,0.2,Positive,1
easy to download very easy to use and,0.49833333333333335,Positive,1
very much accessible but right now it,0.33035714285714285,Positive,1
doesn't look like it's the case the,0.0,Neutral,0
actual games that are made for the apple,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro they're all locked behind,-0.4,Negative,0
apple arcade i mean if you want to play,-0.3125,Negative,0
games here and there i'd say it's worth,0.3,Positive,1
it but still vr games would actually,0.0,Neutral,0
demonstrate how much of a beast this,0.2,Positive,1
thing is and it's not something that,0.0,Neutral,0
apple cannot do so having virtual,0.0,Neutral,0
reality apps native on the apple vision,0.0,Neutral,0
pro would be,0.0,Neutral,0
amazing all right so this next point has,0.29523809523809524,Positive,1
to be,0.0,Neutral,0
i'll consider it a pet peeve so yeah the,0.0,Neutral,0
next point i have that i want apple to,0.0,Neutral,0
fix in my wish list is the fact that we,0.0,Neutral,0
only have one source audio channels i,0.0,Neutral,0
mean for example if i want to play one,-0.3125,Negative,0
of my videos right here and let's say i,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
just play a video the video is playing,0.0,Neutral,0
you can hear the audio but if i want to,0.0,Neutral,0
play music in the background it's,0.0,Neutral,0
automatically going to pause my video,0.0,Neutral,0
and play the music but then if i go and,0.0,Neutral,0
play the video it automatically stops,0.0,Neutral,0
the music but plays the video so that's,0.0,Neutral,0
my issue i mean for an apple device that,-0.3125,Negative,0
allows you to actually uh have multiple,0.0,Neutral,0
apps out and about i would like to see,0.0,Neutral,0
more audio sources like i can open apple,0.25,Positive,1
tv over here i can open disney plus over,0.0,Neutral,0
here i mean i can open what the imax app,-0.15625,Negative,0
over here i can open a bunch of,0.0,Neutral,0
different apps all of about it should,0.0,Neutral,0
allow me to actually,0.0,Neutral,0
have these different apps play all the,0.0,Neutral,0
audio sources available but it doesn't,0.4,Positive,1
look like that's the case like it just,0.0,Neutral,0
seems like apple wants you to focus on,0.2,Positive,1
one thing but it's kind of opposite of,0.3,Positive,1
what the apple vision pro is supposed to,0.0,Neutral,0
be i understand too many audio sources,0.5,Positive,1
could be hard to relocate and stop the,-0.2916666666666667,Negative,0
music or stop the video if you're trying,0.0,Neutral,0
to look for a specific app that has,0.0,Neutral,0
audio coming from one specific app but,0.0,Neutral,0
it doesn't seem to be a challenge apple,0.0,Neutral,0
can actually figure out a way for for,0.0,Neutral,0
someone to actually know what app is,0.0,Neutral,0
making what sound and either stop the,0.4,Positive,1
music or stop the audio from that app,0.0,Neutral,0
and just have other apps play music or,-0.125,Negative,0
video or any type of audio at the same,0.0,Neutral,0
time so yes apple please add multiple,0.0,Neutral,0
audio sources to the apple vision pro i,0.0,Neutral,0
hope this is just a software problem,0.0,Neutral,0
that they can update and fix but if not,0.0,Neutral,0
then it's actually going to be very much,0.13,Positive,1
of a bummer because this is supposed to,0.0,Neutral,0
be a multi- multitask in device but,0.0,Neutral,0
doesn't seem to want you to multitask,0.0,Neutral,0
when you're having audio coming out,0.0,Neutral,0
coming out of different apps so apple,0.0,Neutral,0
please fix this please those are my wish,0.0,Neutral,0
list options for the apple vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
wwdc is coming up very soon i mean we're,-0.056249999999999994,Negative,0
just about a month or and a half away,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
from wwdc so we might see some vision,0.0,Neutral,0
pro updates i mean we have two types of,-0.3125,Negative,0
updates that we might get at wwdc either,0.0,Neutral,0
updates that will please the consumer,0.0,Neutral,0
maybe quality of life updates for the,0.0,Neutral,0
apple vision pro or significant,0.375,Positive,1
development updates for app development,0.0,Neutral,0
and game development for the apple,-0.4,Negative,0
vision pro that might please the,0.0,Neutral,0
developers but consumers will not feel,0.0,Neutral,0
those effects maybe a year or a year and,0.0,Neutral,0
a half from then so we can either be,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
very very excited for consumers after,0.48750000000000004,Positive,1
wwdc or consumers might just be bored,-0.5,Negative,0
with the updates and not really see any,-0.1,Negative,0
big significant improvements but apple,0.1875,Positive,1
has already done a lot of updates to the,0.0,Neutral,0
apple vision pro without a huge number,0.4000000000000001,Positive,1
increase i mean with the multiple,-0.15625,Negative,0
personas in a shared environment that,0.0,Neutral,0
came out with vision os 1.2 so that's a,0.0,Neutral,0
big update i mean we didn't have to wait,-0.15625,Negative,0
for a 2.0 for that but who knows maybe,0.0,Neutral,0
we'll see more things with vision os 2.0,0.5,Positive,1
or maybe we might not see anything more,0.5,Positive,1
for consumer and everything will just be,0.0,Neutral,0
backend stuff for developers we're very,0.2,Positive,1
very close to wwdc i will be live,0.16818181818181818,Positive,1

yeah see you guys on another video peace,0.0,Neutral,0
when apple put their logo on a vr,0.0,Neutral,0
headset we knew the world was going to,0.0,Neutral,0
change this is one of the most,0.5,Positive,1
revolutionary pieces of technology i've,0.0,Neutral,0

able to interact with our environment in,0.5,Positive,1

photo.com and this is the apple vision,0.0,Neutral,0
pro now i purchased this myself and it,0.0,Neutral,0
was let's see,0.0,Neutral,0
"3,800 plus with tax because i got the",0.0,Neutral,0
512 gigabyte version and in this video,0.0,Neutral,0
i'm going to give my initial thoughts a,0.0,Neutral,0
little bit of a review from using it but,-0.1875,Negative,0
more importantly is can i use it to,0.45,Positive,1
replace my screen or my laptop display,0.0,Neutral,0
and edit photos edit video edit whatever,0.0,Neutral,0
you need to edit is it capable of doing,0.2,Positive,1
that and one of the biggest questions i,0.0,Neutral,0
want to answer is this usable on the,0.0,Neutral,0
road where you want to have a bigger,0.0,Neutral,0
display but only have a 14 or a 16-in,0.0,Neutral,0
laptop display so i am going to take you,0.0,Neutral,0
inside of the vision pro i'm also going,0.0,Neutral,0
to show you me casting my desktop to see,0.0,Neutral,0
if i can edit in lightroom and also use,0.0,Neutral,0
lightroom mobile but before i do that,0.0,Neutral,0
the first time i put this on my reaction,0.25,Positive,1
was wo,0.0,Neutral,0
it was just mindblowing when you go,0.0,Neutral,0
inside this world now the pass through,0.0,Neutral,0
video you can still tell that it's video,0.0,Neutral,0
but when you start grabbing stuff and,0.0,Neutral,0
moving it around and having facetimes,0.0,Neutral,0
open and being able to move this and,0.25,Positive,1
type text and do all of those things it,0.0,Neutral,0
is really incredible what you're able to,0.7,Positive,1
do in there but i do want to give a,0.0,Neutral,0
little word of warning for anybody,-0.1875,Negative,0
that's trying to pick one up is that,0.0,Neutral,0
this part comes off this is magnetized,0.0,Neutral,0
so if you try to take it off your face,0.0,Neutral,0
using this it's heavy enough that it's,-0.1,Negative,0
going to possibly fall off and break,0.0,Neutral,0
your super expensive vision pro so you,-0.08333333333333334,Negative,0
want to take it off from the metal take,0.0,Neutral,0
it off from the sides don't do it from,0.0,Neutral,0
the thing that's magnetized there are,0.0,Neutral,0
quirks to this and i do expect that,0.0,Neutral,0
apple will make it better over time in,0.5,Positive,1
software and of course in the hardware,0.0,Neutral,0
it would be great if there was like a,0.8,Positive,1
lock a lock that said hey the magnets,0.0,Neutral,0
will not fall off now and when you,0.0,Neutral,0
unlock it the magnet will work and then,0.0,Neutral,0
you can take it off that's just one,0.0,Neutral,0
thing to be aware ware of now i did take,0.25,Positive,1
off the solo loop strap and ended up,0.0,Neutral,0
putting on the other one that goes,-0.125,Negative,0
around the back of your head and the top,0.25,Positive,1
of your head because i found that the,0.0,Neutral,0
solo loop strap weighed down on my nose,-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
on my cheeks and it was just,0.0,Neutral,0
uncomfortable to use for long term i did,-0.275,Negative,0
stay in for over 2 hours with this on,0.0,Neutral,0
and when i did take it off i had an,0.0,Neutral,0
impression on my face because it does,0.0,Neutral,0
leave an impression but all in all i was,0.0,Neutral,0
able to wear it and i hope in the future,0.25,Positive,1
they're able to shrink it make it,0.5,Positive,1
lighter make it less expensive uh and,-0.3333333333333333,Negative,0
and the battery life yeah no you're,0.0,Neutral,0
going to get like 2 and 1 halfish to 3,0.0,Neutral,0
hours depending on what you're doing,0.0,Neutral,0
right now not that big of a deal because,0.14285714285714285,Positive,1
what this thing offers you is pretty,0.175,Positive,1
cool today and what it offers you for,0.22499999999999998,Positive,1
the future is really what you need to,0.1,Positive,1
look at as this is first generation but,0.25,Positive,1
what we can do by going into lightroom,0.0,Neutral,0
mobile as well as lightroom is pretty,0.25,Positive,1
awesome so i want to jump into the,1.0,Positive,1
system and keep in mind when i am,0.0,Neutral,0
looking at something on the screen where,0.0,Neutral,0
my eye is looking is going to be sharp,-0.125,Negative,0
anything you see around where i'm not,0.0,Neutral,0
looking that's going to look a little,-0.1875,Negative,0
fuzzy because the way that this is,0.0,Neutral,0
rendering things it's only rendering,0.0,Neutral,0
what i'm looking at and when i quickly,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
look somewhere else it renders it then,0.0,Neutral,0
and there so just be aware that what's,0.25,Positive,1
seen around the outside of where i'm,0.0,Neutral,0
looking won't be super sharp so now,0.10416666666666666,Positive,1
let's take off the glasses cuz you can't,0.0,Neutral,0
wear glasses in here and jump into the,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro so is my is my hair okay is,0.5,Positive,1
this thing stephen is this thing messing,0.0,Neutral,0
up my hair yep it it is messing up my,0.0,Neutral,0
yeah it's quite messing up my hair but,0.0,Neutral,0
the good news is it poofs right back up,0.32857142857142857,Positive,1
after i take this thing off so to make,0.0,Neutral,0
this easier i'm going to go on to the,0.0,Neutral,0
moon just so that the background isn't a,0.0,Neutral,0
distraction here because you can see all,0.0,Neutral,0
around the studio right now normally but,0.21785714285714286,Positive,1
all i need to do is turn the digital,0.0,Neutral,0
crown and here is the moon so what i,0.0,Neutral,0
want to do is start with lightroom,0.0,Neutral,0
mobile i'm going to click the top right,0.39285714285714285,Positive,1
circle button got to click on compatible,0.0,Neutral,0
apps lightroom mobile click on that and,0.0,Neutral,0
lightroom mobile now pops up in front of,0.0,Neutral,0
me i can grab down here i can move it,-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
closer to me i can move it further away,0.0,Neutral,0
oh my god that's so cool i can put it,0.35,Positive,1
over here i could do whatever i want i,0.0,Neutral,0
could also pinch to zoom to go larger i,0.0,Neutral,0
can pinch to zoom to go smaller but if i,0.0,Neutral,0
want to edit an image which these are,0.0,Neutral,0
already these already have a lot of nice,0.6,Positive,1
skittle edits but if i want to go in and,0.0,Neutral,0
do something these aren't raw let's say,-0.23076923076923078,Negative,0
i want to scroll pinch and scroll pinch,0.0,Neutral,0
and scroll oh my god these are such good,0.35,Positive,1
photos i'm so good at this photography,0.7,Positive,1
thing stephen all right let's go to this,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
one i'm going to look at it and it's,0.0,Neutral,0
going to load so over here you can see,0.0,Neutral,0
your lightroom panels and i can just,0.0,Neutral,0
click oh i'm just looking at light now,0.4,Positive,1
keep in mind oh i'm going to show,0.0,Neutral,0
stephen i want to talk to the camera i'm,0.0,Neutral,0
going to get out of here i want to move,0.0,Neutral,0
this up here real quick my eyes shake a,0.5,Positive,1
ton and you can see right now i recorded,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
the pointer moving around last night as,0.0,Neutral,0
i was more tired my eyes jiggle jiggle,0.04999999999999999,Positive,1
jiggle they just bounce around which,0.0,Neutral,0
makes it difficult for for me sometimes,-0.5,Negative,0
so if you do have a nagus or you have,0.0,Neutral,0
some other eye conditions it might be an,-0.125,Negative,0
issue and you may need to use a,0.0,Neutral,0
different set of input devices uh like,0.0,Neutral,0
you could use your neck you could use,0.0,Neutral,0
your wrist you could use your hands,0.0,Neutral,0
differently but in this case you can see,0.0,Neutral,0
how my eye is shaking a ton and that may,0.0,Neutral,0
make it harder for me to find exactly,0.075,Positive,1
where i need to to look okay so let's,0.5,Positive,1
pinch this bring this back down right in,0.04338624338624337,Positive,1
front of my face we're going to go back,0.0,Neutral,0
onto the moon real quick and now this is,0.5,Positive,1
right here can i just click on it to,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
zoom oh i can and then i could zoom in,0.0,Neutral,0
even further,0.0,Neutral,0
so i can do that uh but if i want to,0.0,Neutral,0
edit the exposure i can just grab it i,0.0,Neutral,0
can do contrast i could do everything i,0.0,Neutral,0
can go into presets we have all of the,0.0,Neutral,0
fro packs in there right now we're in,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
frow pack four i can be like oh i want,0.0,Neutral,0

thick ooh thick is pretty baller stephen,-0.1166666666666667,Negative,0
um so thick is really cool and you can,0.024999999999999967,Positive,1
just save it and you can hit done i'm,0.0,Neutral,0
going to hit cancel i didn't want that,0.0,Neutral,0
preset applied so i want to go back into,0.0,Neutral,0
to my gallery this is all the stuff,0.0,Neutral,0
that's basically saved on my phone now,0.0,Neutral,0
if you're an ipad user you can click up,0.0,Neutral,0
here and turn it into ipad mode and you,0.0,Neutral,0
can then scroll through all the images,0.0,Neutral,0
just by clicking and dragging but i want,0.0,Neutral,0
to get this out of the way i'm going to,0.0,Neutral,0
put this over here and oh i've got notes,0.0,Neutral,0
okay let me check out my notes i could,0.5,Positive,1
just throw that right here and check it,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
out we talked about eye condition two,0.0,Neutral,0
ways to connect to your display oh yes i,0.0,Neutral,0
want to connect to my display now right,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
now my clamshell is closed and i know,-0.1,Negative,0
it's over here but i'm going to look up,0.0,Neutral,0
because that's how i get to the control,0.0,Neutral,0
center that is the thing that looks like,-0.1,Negative,0
the nintendo switch then i point to this,0.0,Neutral,0
one with the display click on it jared's,0.0,Neutral,0
2021 let's see it should open up now,0.0,Neutral,0
it's right in front of me my screen will,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
go black and now i have my entire,-0.08333333333333333,Negative,0
desktop this is lightroom regular,0.0,Neutral,0
lightroom now some of you may have,0.0,Neutral,0
questions like can you use a mouse and a,0.0,Neutral,0
keyboard uh oh i want to go back into,0.0,Neutral,0
the regular world here cuz i want to,0.0,Neutral,0
show you my screen is now dark and here,-0.15,Negative,0
is my mouse which i can see i can move,0.0,Neutral,0
this display in front of where my,0.0,Neutral,0
computer was and i can bring it further,0.0,Neutral,0
away or i can bring it closer to me and,0.0,Neutral,0
then go back into the moon so that it,0.0,Neutral,0
just looks like i'm editing on my,0.0,Neutral,0
desktop and i can move it further away i,0.0,Neutral,0
can come down here to the bottom corner,-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
and i can scroll,0.0,Neutral,0
it low light your hands may not appear,0.2,Positive,1
yeah cuz we're we're testing in low,0.0,Neutral,0
light here oh there drag oh my god it's,0.15000000000000002,Positive,1
so big i know that's what she said but,0.0,Neutral,0
one of the things i would like is for,0.0,Neutral,0
the screen to curve ever so slightly so,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
i could you know i have to move all the,0.0,Neutral,0
way over here hey there future jared,0.0,Neutral,0
here with my hair down and freshly,0.0722222222222222,Positive,1
shaved to let you know that what you're,0.0,Neutral,0
seeing on the screen that's recorded,0.0,Neutral,0
from my vision pro isn't exactly what,0.25,Positive,1
i'm seeing so if you see me talking and,0.0,Neutral,0
you see it shaking it's not shaking at,0.0,Neutral,0
all when i'm inside of the viewfinder,0.0,Neutral,0
now you're seeing a compressed recording,0.0,Neutral,0
from the vision proos headset i see a,0.0,Neutral,0
larger slightly larger field of view,0.0,Neutral,0
than what you're seeing and of course i,0.0,Neutral,0
see 360 all the way around so just keep,0.0,Neutral,0
that in mind that what i see is super,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
sharp super colorful super contrasty and,0.21041666666666664,Positive,1
looks incredible and you're seeing,0.9,Positive,1
something that's a little bit more,0.15625,Positive,1
compressed but it's still cool that i,0.35,Positive,1
can take you inside of the vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
and share what i see with you so let's,0.0,Neutral,0
get back into the headset this is so,0.0,Neutral,0
amazing oh my god oh and by the way,0.6000000000000001,Positive,1
lightroom is still open back here and my,0.0,Neutral,0
notes are still open behind me and if i,-0.2,Negative,0
was to get text or phone calls i could,0.0,Neutral,0
have that open i could have music open,0.0,Neutral,0
um but i can have this right in front of,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
me and this is the crazy thing i'm using,-0.6,Negative,0
my mouse i can use my keyboard oh my god,0.0,Neutral,0
this is like having a super huge 100in,0.3666666666666667,Positive,1
display in front of me i can do this oh,0.0,Neutral,0
one of the things you need to know is,0.0,Neutral,0
that you can still scroll up to the top,0.5,Positive,1
and have all of your desktops available,0.4,Positive,1
that's one of the things that i was more,0.5,Positive,1
concerned about i'm just looking at a,0.0,Neutral,0
moon that was one of the things i was,0.0,Neutral,0
most concerned about hey stephen i,0.5,Positive,1
thought you could only have one monitor,0.0,Neutral,0
now you can have one monitor but you can,0.0,Neutral,0
still get to multiple desktops and,0.0,Neutral,0
that's not a problem at all so you this,0.0,Neutral,0
this answers the question you could take,0.0,Neutral,0
this on the road with you and sit in a,0.0,Neutral,0
hotel room and edit be on an airplane,0.0,Neutral,0
and edit or if you say i see baseball,0.0,Neutral,0
photographers all the time at the,0.0,Neutral,0
phillies games or wherever they're,0.0,Neutral,0
always editing in their little laptops i,-0.1875,Negative,0
would prefer to put this thing on i,0.0,Neutral,0
could be in my own world and just view,0.6,Positive,1
and edit on a bigger display cuz i don't,0.0,Neutral,0
see very well the other big questions,0.025000000000000005,Positive,1
are is the display accurate now that's,0.4000000000000001,Positive,1
very difficult to say because the,-0.65,Negative,0
brightness is constantly changing i have,0.0,Neutral,0
to see if there's it's also a little too,-0.1875,Negative,0
close to me right now so i want to move,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
it,0.0,Neutral,0
away and that low light thing does pop,0.2,Positive,1
up again you're going to do this in,0.0,Neutral,0
better lighting but just keep in mind,0.5,Positive,1
that's what happens oh my god this is,0.0,Neutral,0
great i can just come in here and and i,0.8,Positive,1
can change the exposure uh i can't see,0.0,Neutral,0
my keyboard right now so i can't undo it,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
but i think i know where undo would be,0.0,Neutral,0
it would be somewhere right,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
here yeah i did it i did it without,0.0,Neutral,0
being able to see uh you could scroll,0.5,Positive,1
through all of your different presets,0.0,Neutral,0
that you have from fro pack 1 two 3 and,0.0,Neutral,0
four go to fronos photo.com fropack 4 to,0.0,Neutral,0
help me pay for these goggles because,0.0,Neutral,0
"they were 3,800 and your preset money",0.0,Neutral,0
would be uh very appreciative for,0.78,Positive,1
helping to pay these goggles off but,0.0,Neutral,0
yeah so you can go through pick images,0.0,Neutral,0
oh that's a very very very gruesome,-1.0,Negative,0
image then go,0.0,Neutral,0
through library as you normally would,0.15,Positive,1
you could edit your videos through here,0.0,Neutral,0
this is incredible i mean this to have a,0.29375,Positive,1
display like this that that i can just,0.0,Neutral,0
come in here and i can zoom in i can,0.0,Neutral,0
grab here i'm like oh i want to see it,0.0,Neutral,0
closer i'm like oh hey look it's bryce,0.0,Neutral,0
harper i can bring him a little closer,-0.1875,Negative,0
to me and now the screen is right in oh,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
i can lean into it oh i got to be,0.0,Neutral,0
careful cuz there's a screen really in,0.05,Positive,1
front of me i don't want to do it but,0.0,Neutral,0
yeah i can zoom in and i can look closer,0.0,Neutral,0
i can grab it again and i can just move,0.0,Neutral,0
it all over wherever i want it to go i,0.0,Neutral,0
can put it right next to the other,0.05357142857142857,Positive,1
lightroom if i want i can put it oh my,0.0,Neutral,0
god look how far i put it far into space,0.1,Positive,1
and it's so g darn huge but let me let,0.4000000000000001,Positive,1
me check my notes real quick again let's,0.5,Positive,1
see screen casting is cool made screen,0.35,Positive,1
too large yeah i wish it was curved i,0.21428571428571427,Positive,1
talked about that can unlock apps oh yes,0.0,Neutral,0
um one of the things you can't do is,0.0,Neutral,0
unlock your well you can you you can't,0.0,Neutral,0
use face id so if you're using an app,0.0,Neutral,0
that needs your face as of right now you,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
can't unlock it unless you move the,0.0,Neutral,0
visor away and take it off a little bit,-0.1875,Negative,0
so it can unlock your phone but what is,0.0,Neutral,0
super cool is that i can in order to,0.3416666666666667,Positive,1
paste from you could copy something from,0.0,Neutral,0
your phone or your computer which is,0.0,Neutral,0
pretty cool you just need to look double,0.19999999999999998,Positive,1
tap your,0.0,Neutral,0
fingers and you can either cut something,0.0,Neutral,0
you can paste something that's how you,0.0,Neutral,0
do it you double tap it and you can copy,0.0,Neutral,0
and you can can past so that is pretty,0.0,Neutral,0
pretty cool let's see can't cast in,0.3,Positive,1
mirror at the same time my eye issues uh,0.0,Neutral,0
you'll see it sharp we talked about this,-0.125,Negative,0
things to show lightroom of course,0.0,Neutral,0
skittles premiere will show you a little,-0.1875,Negative,0
bit later and i'm opening a bunch of,0.0,Neutral,0
stuff up but this is this the the the,0.0,Neutral,0
moral of the story here is can you take,0.0,Neutral,0
this on the road and it actually feels,0.0,Neutral,0
really nice on my face stephen i i kind,0.6,Positive,1
of forgot i was wearing it for a minute,0.0,Neutral,0
i know it makes me look weird and i'm,-0.5,Negative,0
messing my hair up i'd wear this on an,0.0,Neutral,0
airplane to watch a movie the,0.0,Neutral,0
entertainment is incredible just make,0.9,Positive,1
sure you use airpod pros in your ears,0.5,Positive,1
because you don't want to use the other,-0.125,Negative,0
microphones because people sorry your,-0.5,Negative,0
headphones cu other people will be able,0.1875,Positive,1
to hear you with the built-in speakers,0.0,Neutral,0
but i could 100% take this on the road,0.0,Neutral,0
and edit photos with it now i don't know,0.0,Neutral,0
that the color is going to be incredible,0.9,Positive,1
or it's going to be perfect because you,1.0,Positive,1
don't see the same amount of colors as,0.0,Neutral,0
you do on your mac display or on your,0.0,Neutral,0
cinema display but it looks pretty darn,0.25,Positive,1
good to me right here the color look,0.4928571428571428,Positive,1
vibrant they look saturated the white,0.08333333333333333,Positive,1
balance looks pretty good but will it be,0.475,Positive,1
perfect i think it's going to be close,1.0,Positive,1
enough and if you're someone who edits,0.0,Neutral,0
in premiere i think it's going to be a,0.0,Neutral,0
gamechanger for being able to use the,0.4,Positive,1
mouse and the keyboard because you can,0.0,Neutral,0
use the pass through mode and you're,0.0,Neutral,0
going to be able to just move things,0.5,Positive,1
around edit on your timeline as if you,0.0,Neutral,0
were just at home but sitting there with,0.0,Neutral,0
a bigger display you won't have multiple,0.0,Neutral,0
monitor support yet but maybe that's,0.0,Neutral,0
something that they'll change in the,0.0,Neutral,0
future one thing you will notice right,0.14285714285714285,Positive,1
now if you're looking at stephen is that,0.0,Neutral,0
it might be a little jiggly because he's,-0.1875,Negative,0
in the dark and that's because the,-0.15,Negative,0
sensors will slow the shutter speed down,-0.2277777777777778,Negative,0
causing it to blur a little bit in lower,-0.1875,Negative,0
light situations but all in all i am,0.4,Positive,1
pretty amazed and pretty happy with this,0.43333333333333335,Positive,1
"is it worth the 3,500 or 3,800 plus",0.3,Positive,1
all of the extra taxes and if you go for,0.0,Neutral,0
the 512 or the 1 tbyte the answer to,0.0,Neutral,0
that is for the everyday person probably,-0.2,Negative,0
not at this point but if there is a,0.0,Neutral,0
feature and a function that will help,0.0,Neutral,0
you on the road so you don't have to,0.0,Neutral,0
take a display on the road this is an,0.0,Neutral,0
expensive display at 35 plus100 but if,-0.5,Negative,0
you got the funds and it will help you,0.0,Neutral,0
do your work better on the road and make,0.5,Positive,1
you more money then maybe it's something,0.5,Positive,1
that you purchase the goal here i think,0.0,Neutral,0
from apple is uh that this is a first,0.25,Positive,1
gen product now from a first gen,0.25,Positive,1
perspective i think this is better than,0.5,Positive,1
what i expected the results to be,-0.1,Negative,0
there's times where you take the headset,0.0,Neutral,0
off and i know mkbhd said this you take,0.0,Neutral,0
the headset off and you want to move,0.0,Neutral,0
things in virtual space cuz you expect,0.0,Neutral,0
windows to open up the future contact,0.0,Neutral,0
lenses that have this built in uh,0.0,Neutral,0
glasses that have it built in that's 5,0.0,Neutral,0
10 years away if maybe more if not more,0.125,Positive,1
but right now expensive but really cool,0.04523809523809522,Positive,1
so i'm going to continue to use this i,0.0,Neutral,0
don't think i'm going to return it i,0.0,Neutral,0
think that i'm going to keep it and pay,0.0,Neutral,0
it off over the 12 months that apple,0.0,Neutral,0
gives you with their financing same as,0.0,Neutral,0
cash cuz it's well worth it,0.3,Positive,1
uh but that's it guys any questions,0.0,Neutral,0
please leave them down below thank you,-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
very much for watching this uh don't,0.26,Positive,1
forget to pick up some presets to help,0.0,Neutral,0
me pay for this bad boy and then we call,-0.6999999999999998,Negative,0
it a day right there jared poen fronos,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
photo.com see you woo i'm on the,0.0,Neutral,0
moon,0.0,Neutral,0
music,0.0,Neutral,0
morning another day another raw test,-0.23076923076923078,Negative,0
today we're doing on the apple vision,0.0,Neutral,0
pro and i'm sure you have seen it,0.5,Positive,1
everywhere by now but i promise this,0.0,Neutral,0
video is not me just wandering around,0.0,Neutral,0
with it on my face and frankly i don't,0.0,Neutral,0
think there's a reason to use this in,0.0,Neutral,0
public and anyone that you see on the,0.0,Neutral,0
internet doing so is more likely than,0.25,Positive,1
not doing it to be intentionally,0.0,Neutral,0
evocative to simply get views so,0.0,Neutral,0
regardless unlike my laptop phone,0.0,Neutral,0
earbuds ebike etc rear world tests that,0.0,Neutral,0
i usually do here on the channel we,-0.25,Negative,0
won't be exploring very much as this is,0.26,Positive,1
just not a product that you should be,0.0,Neutral,0
out and about with in that sense but it,0.0,Neutral,0
is a proper rear whe test of how this,0.0,Neutral,0
product should be used and i actually,0.0,Neutral,0
think i have some things to show you,0.0,Neutral,0
guys that you probably haven't seen just,0.0,Neutral,0
yet so without further ado let's test,0.0,Neutral,0
out this new headset but first things,0.19318181818181818,Positive,1
first,0.25,Positive,1
music,0.0,Neutral,0
coffee check and let's start with some,0.0,Neutral,0
of the basics of how apple vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
works for those unfamiliar really quick,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
essentially it has displays inside one,0.0,Neutral,0
for each eye and you can get magnetic,0.0,Neutral,0
prescription lenses made by zeiss,0.0,Neutral,0
included in the price if you need them i,0.0,Neutral,0
am nearsighted so a pair of these helped,0.0,Neutral,0
me out there are cameras on the outside,0.0,Neutral,0
that capture the outside world and then,0.0,Neutral,0
they project that on the displays on the,0.0,Neutral,0
inside and the apps you see are then,0.0,Neutral,0
overlaid on top of that world view there,0.5,Positive,1
are also cameras on the bottom of the,0.0,Neutral,0
headset used to track your hands as well,0.0,Neutral,0
as some cameras inside tracking your eye,0.0,Neutral,0
movement the main way that you interact,0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
with the device basically you look at,0.0,Neutral,0
something and then you use your hands to,0.0,Neutral,0
interact with it pinching your fingers,0.0,Neutral,0
to select pinching and flicking to,0.0,Neutral,0
scroll up or down and pinching and,-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
dragging on the line under an app to,0.0,Neutral,0
move it or the corner of the app to,0.0,Neutral,0
resize it now a lot of this is similar,0.0,Neutral,0
to other xr headsets but there are,-0.125,Negative,0
definitely some differences the hand,0.0,Neutral,0
tracking for example is on other devices,-0.125,Negative,0
here and there but it's nowhere near as,0.1,Positive,1
intuitive or well tracked as here the ey,0.0,Neutral,0
tracking is also something very,0.2,Positive,1
intuitive and something i really haven't,0.2,Positive,1
seen very well implemented anywhere else,0.2,Positive,1
and the os itself is built for these,0.0,Neutral,0
interactions instead of controller first,0.25,Positive,1
like others honestly for me one of the,0.6,Positive,1
most impressive things about this device,0.75,Positive,1
is that eye and hand tracking i've used,0.0,Neutral,0
other device albeit a long time ago with,-0.0875,Negative,0
similar features and none of them have,0.0,Neutral,0
even come close to how good this is also,0.7,Positive,1
the resolution and the sharpness of the,0.0,Neutral,0
displays and the exterior cameras is,0.0,Neutral,0
noticeably better than say the meta,0.5,Positive,1
quest 3 and yes considering the price,0.0,Neutral,0
car between these it should be the world,0.0,Neutral,0
view though because of that is way,0.0,Neutral,0
sharper and it actually a clever way of,0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
sharpening only what you're looking at,0.0,Neutral,0
thanks to that eye tracking to save on,0.2,Positive,1
processing and battery compared to,0.0,Neutral,0
having the entire display sharp all the,-0.0625,Negative,0
time it's also how your eyes actually,0.0,Neutral,0
work kind of now it's also noticeably,0.6,Positive,1
heavier than other headsets and it,-0.125,Negative,0
actually feels like it's kind of pulling,0.3,Positive,1
down on my cheeks a bit but even with,-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
that i'm able to use it for a decent,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
amount of time the secondary head strap,-0.3,Negative,0
that adds a bit more support helps with,0.5,Positive,1
that though to some degree but it,0.0,Neutral,0
definitely doesn't negate it it for me,0.0,Neutral,0
at least okay but what can you actually,0.06666666666666667,Positive,1
do with,0.0,Neutral,0
music,0.0,Neutral,0
it,0.0,Neutral,0
hello well i assume you're familiar,0.375,Positive,1
already with how it works as this video,0.0,Neutral,0
is going live well after it's released,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
and i'm sure there were a ton of other,0.1875,Positive,1
videos that you probably watched before,0.0,Neutral,0
you got to this one so i will spare you,0.0,Neutral,0
the in-depth walk through but basically,0.0,Neutral,0
you can use vision pro specific apps,0.0,Neutral,0
that either open in a movable resizable,0.0,Neutral,0
window in front of you or open as a full,0.175,Positive,1
world view aka virtual reality and you,0.0,Neutral,0
are immersed inside the app we also have,0.0,Neutral,0
ipad apps that you can run which also,0.0,Neutral,0
open in one of these floating movable,0.0,Neutral,0
resizable windows as well now these apps,0.0,Neutral,0
aren't without glitches here and there i,0.0,Neutral,0
actually had a bunch of them crash many,0.25,Positive,1
times when i first got the device on,0.25,Positive,1
launch day and a little bit thereafter,-0.1875,Negative,0
but i will say i haven't had any issues,0.0,Neutral,0
lately compared to then developers have,-0.3,Negative,0
jumped on fixing things as has apple,0.0,Neutral,0
themselves more on that later now the,0.25,Positive,1
apps that really shine of course are the,0.2,Positive,1
ones made for vision pro that take,0.0,Neutral,0
advantage of the spatial awareness some,0.0,Neutral,0
good examples of this being 3d puzzle,0.7,Positive,1
apps where you can walk around a puzzle,0.0,Neutral,0
and rotate it and put pieces together,0.0,Neutral,0
there's actually a really fun dj app,0.3,Positive,1
that gives you a dj like deck that you,0.0,Neutral,0
can put vinyl on and actually scratch,0.0,Neutral,0
and do mixing and actually kind of,0.6,Positive,1
mimics the feeling of really djing a set,0.2,Positive,1
which is kind of cool and even apps like,0.475,Positive,1
this one that you can take 3d models and,0.0,Neutral,0
take them apart and put them back,0.0,Neutral,0
together and see inside them and it's,0.0,Neutral,0
just kind of a a neat educational,0.425,Positive,1
learning tool and kind of showcases some,0.6,Positive,1
of the spatial awareness abilities that,0.0,Neutral,0
you can do on this something else cool,0.35,Positive,1
is how it automatically recognizes apple,0.0,Neutral,0
macbooks for example that you're logged,0.0,Neutral,0
into with the same account and it pops,0.0,Neutral,0
up an option over it to connect and then,0.0,Neutral,0
you can use it with the vision pro that,0.0,Neutral,0
automatic interaction itself just it,0.0,Neutral,0
just feels kind of like the future,0.3,Positive,1
honestly this then allows you to say use,0.6,Positive,1
your macbook and put a giant version of,0.0,Neutral,0
the screen in the air or multiple,0.0,Neutral,0
windows to mimic a floating set of,0.0,Neutral,0
monitors which is actually kind of,0.6,Positive,1
useful i even tried while traveling,0.3,Positive,1
using a bluetooth keyboard and mouse,0.0,Neutral,0
connected to the apple vision pro to,0.0,Neutral,0
just be more comfortable in bed while,0.45,Positive,1
using it one thing that's truly,0.0,Neutral,0
impressive though is the fact that the,1.0,Positive,1
apps just feel like they're physically,0.0,Neutral,0
in the space like apple does a good job,0.7,Positive,1
of that and the ability to pin these app,0.0,Neutral,0
windows wherever you want and then leave,0.0,Neutral,0
the room take off the device even go,0.0,Neutral,0
from one building to another and have,0.0,Neutral,0
the apps still remain where you,0.0,Neutral,0
originally put them is impressive so,0.6875,Positive,1
that's kind of a quick gist of what you,0.4666666666666667,Positive,1
can do with it but what should you do,0.0,Neutral,0
"with it and what justifies that 3,500",0.0,Neutral,0
price,0.0,Neutral,0
music,0.0,Neutral,0
music,0.0,Neutral,0
tag so as mentioned this should not be,0.0,Neutral,0
used in public it should be used maybe,0.0,Neutral,0
at a desk of an office or in your,0.0,Neutral,0
apartment with maybe the exception of,0.0,Neutral,0
like on an airplane because that's the i,0.0,Neutral,0
can think of where your actual laptop,0.0,Neutral,0
might be difficult to use like cramped,-0.5,Negative,0
in an airplane seat you will of course,0.0,Neutral,0
still look like a potentially,0.0,Neutral,0
pretentious because everyone knows at,-0.3,Negative,0
this point how much this thing costs bug,0.2,Positive,1
in front of strangers but i guess at,0.0,Neutral,0
least does solve a problem in that case,-0.3,Negative,0
and gives you more screen real estate,0.35,Positive,1
beyond that though the laptop with,0.0,Neutral,0
multiple screens is a use case that is,0.0,Neutral,0
pretty solid as is maybe using it to,0.125,Positive,1
surf the web in bed and gaming or using,0.0,Neutral,0
it in your living room to say watch 3d,0.0,Neutral,0
movies is a good use too but i still,0.7,Positive,1
have a hard time justifying the cost,-0.2916666666666667,Negative,0
especially when other headsets like the,-0.0625,Negative,0
500 meta quest 3 can also do these,0.0,Neutral,0
things not as well for sure but,0.5,Positive,1
relatively well enough for a seventh of,0.0,Neutral,0
the price but what if your profession,0.0,Neutral,0
could actually use a spatially aware,0.125,Positive,1
computer or there was somewhere where,0.0,Neutral,0
maybe it could kind of pay for itself i,0.6,Positive,1
used it not too long ago to help design,-0.05,Negative,0
a kitchen i used a free app and was able,0.45,Positive,1
to place kitchen items like cabinets a,0.0,Neutral,0
stove etc where i thought they should go,0.0,Neutral,0
and then use that to show show the,0.0,Neutral,0
contractor who then built the cabinets,0.0,Neutral,0
and it truly felt like a useful addition,0.3,Positive,1
to that workflow it meant less back and,-0.08333333333333333,Negative,0
forth a better job was done etc now if,0.5,Positive,1
my contractor had one and he could then,0.0,Neutral,0
use it to show his perspective clients,0.0,Neutral,0
what his work would look like when it,0.0,Neutral,0
was done that could maybe help him make,0.0,Neutral,0
sales in fact 3d rendering is a common,-0.3,Negative,0
marketing tactic for interior designers,0.0,Neutral,0
architects and others that is known to,0.0,Neutral,0
help sell clients and increase revenue,0.0,Neutral,0
they can all also create models way more,0.5,Positive,1
in tively as well using the apple vision,0.0,Neutral,0
pro way better than like a cad software,0.5,Positive,1
that you would traditionally use in two,0.0,Neutral,0
dimensions now again you could,0.0,Neutral,0
technically do this on a meta quest but,0.0,Neutral,0
these more professional apps don't,0.3,Positive,1
really exist or at least not good ones,-0.15,Negative,0
on the meta quest and part of that is,0.0,Neutral,0
because of the fact that the meta's own,0.6,Positive,1
marketing portrays it as more of an,0.5,Positive,1
entertaining toy developers and,0.5,Positive,1
designers don't necessarily think of it,0.0,Neutral,0
as much of a tool and there are some,0.2,Positive,1
exceptions to that but for the most part,0.5,Positive,1
that's true but apple traditionally very,0.275,Positive,1
recognized by design as a tool for their,0.0,Neutral,0
jobs they don't have that hurdle,0.0,Neutral,0
regardless though apple still needs,0.0,Neutral,0
developers to make apps that are,0.0,Neutral,0
specific to the apple vision pro to make,0.0,Neutral,0
it really useful which is why whether,0.3,Positive,1
qualifying it as a business expense is,0.0,Neutral,0
how people could maybe justify the cost,0.0,Neutral,0
better the truth is is that this feels,0.5,Positive,1
very much like apple didn't call this a,0.26,Positive,1
developer kit even if it kind of might,0.6,Positive,1
have been that you see if they called it,0.0,Neutral,0
a developer kit then only developers,0.0,Neutral,0
would have bought one really but what if,0.2,Positive,1
they just launched it with a high price,0.16,Positive,1
tag something usually common for some,-0.3,Negative,0
developer kits as the developers can,0.0,Neutral,0
justify that high cost as a necessary,0.08,Positive,1
investment to create the apps that they,0.0,Neutral,0
will in turn maybe make money from,0.0,Neutral,0
somehow and let's just let everyone buy,0.0,Neutral,0
it people get more excited they use it,0.4375,Positive,1
in public and do things to get views it,0.0,Neutral,0
takes over the news cycle like it did,0.0,Neutral,0
and developers just happen to notice the,0.0,Neutral,0
buzz and decide to work on it from that,0.0,Neutral,0
brilliant if true no so to just answer,0.625,Positive,1
the question if you can use this to make,0.0,Neutral,0
money for a business that could benefit,0.0,Neutral,0
in some way from spatial awareness in an,0.0,Neutral,0
app overlaid on the in the real world,0.2,Positive,1
you'd be a good candidate for buying and,0.7,Positive,1
using the apple vision pro right now,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
even possibly but more likely if we're,0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
honest if you're a developer and you're,0.6,Positive,1
looking to make spacially aware apps and,0.25,Positive,1
apple is maybe the demographic that,0.0,Neutral,0
you're going for then you're really who,0.2,Positive,1
this product is for if we're honest and,0.6,Positive,1
there you go hope you guys enjoyed this,0.5,Positive,1

bit night,0.0,Neutral,0
hey everybody welcome back to inoo and,0.4,Positive,1
welcome to the apple vision pro review,0.8,Positive,1
series in part one we proposed the,0.0,Neutral,0
question what was apple thinking as we,0.0,Neutral,0
attempted to dissect the decision-making,0.0,Neutral,0
process and positioning of the apple,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro to better understand the,0.5,Positive,1
point of the device as well as who what,0.0,Neutral,0
and what it was for if you didn't watch,0.0,Neutral,0
it you should check it out here i'll,0.0,Neutral,0
wait today we're going to dig a bit,0.0,Neutral,0
deeper into how the apple vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
functions and cover more traditional,0.25,Positive,1
review topics like its design its,0.0,Neutral,0

but before we begin be sure to hit that,0.5,Positive,1
subscribe button for more detailed tech,0.45,Positive,1
reviews and coverage and like the series,0.0,Neutral,0
all right let's dive in the apple vision,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
pro is undoubtedly the highest quality,0.0,Neutral,0
mixed reality headset that i've ever,0.0,Neutral,0
used in terms of design which is to be,0.0,Neutral,0
expected considering the price between,-0.1,Negative,0
the glass front panel and the aluminum,0.0,Neutral,0
frame it feels incredibly premium all of,0.9,Positive,1
the buttons have this incredibly tactile,0.9,Positive,1
action,0.1,Positive,1
i'm less impressed though by the kind of,0.4777777777777778,Positive,1
floppy rubber arms which make up the,0.0,Neutral,0
fixed part of the headband which have,0.1,Positive,1
the same sort of surface feeling as the,0.0,Neutral,0
airpods pro max headband and the uh,0.0,Neutral,0
apple watch sport band i haven't,0.0,Neutral,0
experienced any discoloration on it,0.8,Positive,1
quite yet but that might possibly happen,0.0,Neutral,0
in the future just based off of this,0.0,Neutral,0
material now what has already happened,0.0,Neutral,0
is somewhere on the ey shield and the,0.0,Neutral,0
solo knit band there's little strands,-0.1875,Negative,0
that have started to kind of fray from,0.6,Positive,1
it which is crazy to think in such a,-0.3,Negative,0
short time frame now fans of my channel,0.0,Neutral,0
know that i'm more concerned with the,0.5,Positive,1
ergonomics of a product rather than the,0.0,Neutral,0
visual design and the ergonomics of the,0.0,Neutral,0
apple vision pro leave a lot to be,0.0,Neutral,0
desired for one the external battery has,0.0,Neutral,0
just a way of getting caught on things,0.0,Neutral,0
when i'm walking around the house or,0.0,Neutral,0
i'll snag against it or you know have it,0.0,Neutral,0
fall on my shoulder uncomfortably when,-0.5,Negative,0
i'm just sitting on the couch just,0.0,Neutral,0
trying to watch a movie now considering,0.0,Neutral,0
heavy the device is even without the,-0.2,Negative,0
battery it's not the most comfortable,0.45,Positive,1
headset that i've worn but it's not,0.0,Neutral,0
really made for kind of longer watch,0.4,Positive,1
sessions in my experience the solo knit,0.0,Neutral,0
band feels like a complete miss it kind,0.35,Positive,1
of squeezes the headset against your,0.0,Neutral,0
face and it leaves red marks and kind of,0.3,Positive,1
like a raccoon around your eyes now the,0.0,Neutral,0
dual loop band on the other hand feels,-0.125,Negative,0
like the better option overall now,0.25,Positive,1
speaking of the general experience let's,0.05000000000000002,Positive,1
talk talk about the user experience of,0.0,Neutral,0
the apple vision pro there are only two,0.0,Neutral,0
physical buttons or controls on the,0.0,Neutral,0
device the digital crown and uh the the,0.0,Neutral,0
other button what does the other button,-0.125,Negative,0
do um it captures photos or videos i,0.0,Neutral,0
guess why did apple really think the,0.2,Positive,1
average person would be capturing photos,-0.15,Negative,0
with this device when a better camera is,0.5,Positive,1
just sitting in their pocket it feels,0.0,Neutral,0
like a complete waste of a button now,-0.05,Negative,0
maybe the future it becomes a custom,0.0,Neutral,0
action button like solution like you,0.1,Positive,1
have in the iphone 15 pro i didn't,0.0,Neutral,0
really naturally want to press it quite,0.1,Positive,1
often and so it felt kind of useless and,0.04999999999999999,Positive,1
then there's the digital crown and i,0.0,Neutral,0
hate the digital crown but before we ask,-0.4,Negative,0
why let's have a quick education session,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
let's talk about digital and analog,0.0,Neutral,0
signals a digital signal is basically on,0.0,Neutral,0
or off it's either one or zero the same,0.0,Neutral,0
way that computers often process,0.0,Neutral,0
information and the way that most sort,0.5,Positive,1
of light switches around your room will,0.4,Positive,1
typically work it's pretty,0.04166666666666667,Positive,1
straightforward and an analog signal on,0.375,Positive,1
the other hand is a little bit different,-0.10416666666666667,Negative,0
in that an analog signal doesn't need to,0.0,Neutral,0
be on or off it could be anything in,0.0,Neutral,0
between completely on or completely off,0.1,Positive,1
it's contiguous and these are very very,0.26,Positive,1
important distinctions because different,0.2,Positive,1
interactions with different operating,0.0,Neutral,0
systems or or different devices very,0.1,Positive,1
importantly will function in different,0.2,Positive,1
ways for example if you happen to have a,0.0,Neutral,0
light switch that is one of those,0.4,Positive,1
turning,0.0,Neutral,0
light switches but all that's happening,0.4,Positive,1
is the light is turning on or off it,0.4,Positive,1
feels like a bad experience and vice,-0.6999999999999998,Negative,0
versa if you have a light that has the,0.4,Positive,1
ability to have varying levels of,0.0,Neutral,0
brightness and all you have is a switch,0.0,Neutral,0
then you are losing the entire benefit,0.0,Neutral,0
of having the varying levels of,0.0,Neutral,0
brightness you can either go on and off,0.0,Neutral,0
now maybe you see where i'm going if,0.0,Neutral,0
you're confused to why the digital crown,-0.2,Negative,0
is called digital despite being analog,0.0,Neutral,0
that's a great question it's because,0.8,Positive,1
apple sucks at naming now what does this,-0.3,Negative,0
have to do with the actual experience of,0.0,Neutral,0
using the apple vision pro well the core,0.0,Neutral,0
function of the digital crown on the,0.0,Neutral,0
apple vision pro is control how,0.0,Neutral,0
immersive your environment is you know,0.0,Neutral,0
the commercials where they show the,0.0,Neutral,0
living room just vanishing around the,0.0,Neutral,0
user that's the digital crown in action,0.05,Positive,1
but my question is why is this an analog,0.0,Neutral,0
control do you really need such,0.1,Positive,1
precision that only this 37.8% of your,0.0,Neutral,0
living room is the moon and the other,-0.125,Negative,0
62.2% is just your living room i,0.0,Neutral,0
honestly believe that the core use case,0.6,Positive,1
of this analog control is just to look,0.0,Neutral,0
fancy and advertisements and marketing,0.0,Neutral,0
but conrad you might say you can control,0.0,Neutral,0
more than just the immersion you can,0.5,Positive,1
also control the volume with it but how,0.0,Neutral,0
do you actually do that how do you,0.0,Neutral,0
control the volume on using the dial,0.0,Neutral,0
well first you've got to spin the dial,0.25,Positive,1
slightly then you have to look,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
specifically and focus on the volume,0.0,Neutral,0
menu and then you can continue to spin,0.0,Neutral,0
it to your desired level at best this,1.0,Positive,1
takes a bit of a learning curve and at,0.0,Neutral,0
worst i just use the control center,-0.55,Negative,0
instead but we're not done ragging on,0.0,Neutral,0
the digital crown it is the primary way,0.2,Positive,1
to navigate the operating system a,0.0,Neutral,0
single press takes you home a double,-0.03571428571428571,Negative,0
press closes all apps and takes you to a,0.0,Neutral,0
completely blank environment and a press,0.0,Neutral,0
and hold reenters all of your apps in,0.0,Neutral,0
front of you but why this feels like a,0.0,Neutral,0
step back in time to 2016 when the,0.0,Neutral,0
iphone had a physical home button,0.0,Neutral,0
instead of of gesture controls with,0.0,Neutral,0
apple pushing the boundaries of what is,0.0,Neutral,0
possible with eye tracking and hand,0.0,Neutral,0
gestures a physical button on top of the,0.25,Positive,1
device just kind of confuses me there's,0.6,Positive,1
something to be said about just how,0.0,Neutral,0
effortless a swipe up on the home screen,0.0,Neutral,0
is to the point where going back to the,0.0,Neutral,0
iphone 8 or the iphone se feels like a,0.0,Neutral,0
regression to me so why apple made a,0.0,Neutral,0
physical button press the core,0.0,Neutral,0
interaction method of how you navigate,0.0,Neutral,0
the operating system bewilders me and,0.0,Neutral,0
that physical button sits on top of your,0.25,Positive,1
face you're reaching up and physically,0.0,Neutral,0
pressing the headset down away from your,-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
eyes in order to interact with this,0.0,Neutral,0
system it's just bizarre now as for the,0.4,Positive,1
face shield this too highlights a,0.0,Neutral,0
significant room for actual user,0.1875,Positive,1
improvement now besides the strange,-0.05,Negative,0
ordering process requiring you to scan,0.0,Neutral,0
your face using an iphone the phase,0.0,Neutral,0
shield made using this device kind of,0.6,Positive,1
unnecessarily isolating in my experience,-0.4,Negative,0
in the bit of time i've used the apple,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro without the face shield,0.0,Neutral,0
attached i actually enjoyed the,0.5,Positive,1
experience much more being able to view,0.5,Positive,1
my peripheral around the apple vision,0.0,Neutral,0
pro mean it almost feel like wearing,-0.3125,Negative,0
true ar glasses there's no real,0.12499999999999999,Positive,1
off-the-shelf way to do this there's,0.0,Neutral,0
several third parties that are making,0.0,Neutral,0
new bands and new face shields that will,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
allow you to more easily use it in this,0.4666666666666667,Positive,1
manner but there's nothing available,0.4,Positive,1
from apple to allow you to do so and,0.0,Neutral,0
that face shield as you saw is,0.0,Neutral,0
completely magnetically attached while,0.1,Positive,1
this is cool if you pick up the device,0.35,Positive,1
by the face shield you risk the face,0.0,Neutral,0
shield dropping off and uh the entire,0.0,Neutral,0
apple vision pro dropping to the floor,0.0,Neutral,0
this is so much of a thing that in all,0.2,Positive,1
of the demos when you sit down and you,-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
you order your apple vision pro and you,0.0,Neutral,0
walk into the store and you get to use,0.0,Neutral,0
it when they walk you through using the,0.0,Neutral,0
product they specifically tell you do,0.0,Neutral,0
not grasp the apple vision pro from the,0.0,Neutral,0
face shield you should very specifically,0.2,Positive,1
lift your finger under this and then,0.0,Neutral,0
grab the the band,0.0,Neutral,0
which it seems to be silly i mean it,-0.40625,Negative,0
seems to be like you should be able to,0.5,Positive,1
grab the device the headset however you,0.0,Neutral,0
want to grab it in order to put it on,0.0,Neutral,0
but it feels very very delicate whenever,-0.39,Negative,0
you do so okay now that i've gotten my,0.5,Positive,1
ranting on the design idiosyncrasies out,0.0,Neutral,0
of the way let's talk about where the,0.0,Neutral,0
apple vision pro really starts to excel,0.2,Positive,1
in the displays now boasting 4k display,0.0,Neutral,0
per ie vr content is just incredibly,0.9,Positive,1
crisp even it's indistinguishable from,0.25,Positive,1
me using a 4k monitor pretty close to my,0.25,Positive,1
face reading text is an excellent,1.0,Positive,1
experience and watching movies or tv,0.0,Neutral,0
shows in the vision pro is just about as,0.0,Neutral,0
good as it gets unless of course you,0.7,Positive,1
enjoy company still there are some,0.4,Positive,1
limitations i found in dark environments,-0.15,Negative,0
reflections and lens flares that show up,0.0,Neutral,0
when viewing content in kind of the,0.6,Positive,1
immersive mode so everything everything,0.0,Neutral,0
around you is dark you got a screen in,-0.15,Negative,0
front of you you see the kind of lens,0.6,Positive,1
flares and light bounce off the lens and,0.4,Positive,1
that's very very distracting for me in,0.26,Positive,1
addition around the edges of the lens i,0.0,Neutral,0
can actually see discoloration this,0.0,Neutral,0
green purple almost like filter which is,-0.2,Negative,0
the distortion of the lens happening and,0.0,Neutral,0
i haven't heard this from everyone only,0.0,Neutral,0
a few people have have experience this,-0.2,Negative,0
and i don't know whether that's where my,0.0,Neutral,0
eyes naturally sit relative to the,0.05,Positive,1
lenses or my unit in particular and,0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
generally while we typically desire,-0.05833333333333332,Negative,0
brighter displays on all of our mobile,0.0,Neutral,0
devices like phones i actually felt the,0.0,Neutral,0
opposite when i was trying to watch a,0.0,Neutral,0
movie on an international flight and,0.0,Neutral,0
even the lowest brightness setting still,0.0,Neutral,0
kind of seared my eyes without bright it,0.65,Positive,1
was i wish there was ability to set it,0.0,Neutral,0
even lower now these critiques are minor,-0.05,Negative,0
though because the inward displays on on,0.0,Neutral,0
the apple vision pro are by far the best,0.55,Positive,1
in class they really make me wish that,0.2,Positive,1
the quest 3 had substantially higher,0.25,Positive,1
resolution toplay diss because in my,0.0,Neutral,0
experience the apple vision pro has,0.0,Neutral,0
ruined watching content on other lower,-0.125,Negative,0
quality ar and vr displays at this point,0.0,Neutral,0
now while the displays are both best in,1.0,Positive,1
class and incredibly impressive one,1.0,Positive,1
feature that still stands out about the,0.0,Neutral,0
apple vision pro but still has a decent,0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
amount to go is the pass through,0.0,Neutral,0
experience now the main culprit for,0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
users feeling motion sick while wearing,-0.7142857142857143,Negative,0
ar-based glasses is the latency between,0.0,Neutral,0
the camera feed and then the projection,0.0,Neutral,0
on the display and the apple vision pros,0.0,Neutral,0
latency is supposedly 3 to four times,0.0,Neutral,0
faster than its competitors which i,0.0,Neutral,0
think substantially prevents the queasy,0.0,Neutral,0
feeling that a lot of ar adopters have,0.0,Neutral,0
felt for years now unless lighting is,0.0,Neutral,0
optimal and even when it is the pass,0.0,Neutral,0
through image quality is just not that,0.0,Neutral,0
convincing it's definitely better than a,0.5,Positive,1
lot of other vr headsets or ar headsets,-0.125,Negative,0
but it still needs some work the object,0.0,Neutral,0
occlusion like when you're hands are uh,0.0,Neutral,0
are positioned in front of you and,0.0,Neutral,0
blurring out virtual objects or uding,0.0,Neutral,0
virtual objects also seems to stand out,0.0,Neutral,0
there is some kind of graininess around,0.6,Positive,1
the edges of your arms and hands but,0.0,Neutral,0
it's still a pretty good experience and,0.475,Positive,1
feels better to me than the quest but,0.5,Positive,1
when the headset actually detects other,-0.0625,Negative,0
objects in the area there's some sort of,0.0,Neutral,0
a partial occlusion that does take place,-0.1,Negative,0
and so windows that are kind of placed,0.6,Positive,1
in other items in your physical area are,-0.0625,Negative,0
become like slightly transparent so for,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
example i have a i have a monitor right,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
here if i put a screen virtually through,0.0,Neutral,0
the monitor it would partially olude the,-0.1,Negative,0
application such that the application,0.0,Neutral,0
becomes kind of translucent there's a,0.6,Positive,1
reason for this and it's specifically to,0.0,Neutral,0
prevent you from running into objects,0.0,Neutral,0
that happen to be sticking out around,0.0,Neutral,0
you but it doesn't seem to work very,0.2,Positive,1
well and in my experience when i was,0.0,Neutral,0
sitting on that international flight,0.0,Neutral,0
what i really wanted to do was move move,0.2,Positive,1
the movie back further away from me so,0.0,Neutral,0
it was more comfortable to view but,0.45,Positive,1
because there was a seat right in front,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
of me i could not do so without the,0.0,Neutral,0
movie becoming translucent so i actually,0.225,Positive,1
had to shift it closer to me as though,0.0,Neutral,0
it was a screen in front of me which,0.0,Neutral,0
really missed on my watch experience but,0.2,Positive,1
let's dial up the immersion and enter,0.0,Neutral,0
the virtual world despite not being,0.0,Neutral,0
called a vr headset the immersive mode,0.0,Neutral,0
of the apple vision pro is meant to,0.0,Neutral,0
achieve the general same goal as pure vr,0.0880952380952381,Positive,1
being able to teleport to a completely,0.3,Positive,1
virtual world that you can interact with,0.0,Neutral,0
is the foundation of what oculus and htc,0.0,Neutral,0
created nearly a decade ago but even at,0.1,Positive,1
the time vr nerds were debating so hotly,0.25,Positive,1
about 6 degrees of freedom and the,0.0,Neutral,0
impact of six degrees of freedom for,0.0,Neutral,0
those who aren't familiar six degrees of,0.375,Positive,1
freedom means that you both have the,0.0,Neutral,0
ability to visually look around your,0.0,Neutral,0
environment but also move around your,0.0,Neutral,0
environment it's what differentiated the,0.0,Neutral,0
htc vibe from for example the google,0.0,Neutral,0
cardboard this was a massive development,0.0,Neutral,0
in vr headsets but why does this have,0.0,Neutral,0
anything to do with the apple vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
obviously being released in 2024 means,0.0,Neutral,0
the apple vision pro has complete six,0.1,Positive,1
degrees of freedom interactions with the,0.0,Neutral,0
world around you right apple's premier,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
vr experience which is the immersed kind,0.6,Positive,1
of home screens that you see on all the,0.0,Neutral,0
advertising those are very very high,0.20800000000000002,Positive,1
resolution and very very impressive in,1.0,Positive,1
terms of just how high fidelity they are,0.16,Positive,1
but they might as well be three degrees,0.0,Neutral,0
of freedom because as soon as you move,0.0,Neutral,0
from one place to another the entire,0.0,Neutral,0
space just disappears there's no,0.0,Neutral,0
exploration around that space and while,0.0,Neutral,0
there are slowly becoming more and more,0.48333333333333334,Positive,1
vr experiences for the apple vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
mostly from third party developers those,0.25,Positive,1
are few and far between and the majority,-0.05,Negative,0
of applications in the apple vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
are either purely ar applications or,0.21428571428571427,Positive,1
ipad applications or they are very much,0.26,Positive,1
three degrees of freedom where you stay,0.0,Neutral,0
in one place and you just kind of look,0.6,Positive,1
around it doesn't have the same sort of,0.0,Neutral,0
magic that i experienced with the htc,0.65,Positive,1
vive so many years ago those,0.5,Positive,1
environments that apple offers off the,0.1,Positive,1
shelf do feel substantially more,0.5,Positive,1
polished than the quest equivalent like,0.0,Neutral,0
home screens though and and speaking of,0.0,Neutral,0
polished ey tracking on the apple vision,0.0,Neutral,0
pro is quite refined especially for a,0.0,Neutral,0
first generation product my first,0.25,Positive,1
experience with eye tracking on the,0.0,Neutral,0
apple vision pro felt like magic and,0.5,Positive,1
while i felt generally the same way,0.02500000000000001,Positive,1
about the first hand tracking experience,0.25,Positive,1
on the quest i do think this is like a,0.0,Neutral,0
whole another level technically the,0.1,Positive,1
quest pro also has eye tracking but it's,0.0,Neutral,0
not a fundamental feature of the,0.0,Neutral,0
operating system the same way it is,0.0,Neutral,0
fundamental to the apple vision pro pro,0.0,Neutral,0
as soon as the hand interaction became,0.0,Neutral,0
kind of refined with the quest pro and,0.6,Positive,1
then the quest 3 i basically would leave,0.0,Neutral,0
my controllers around anywhere because i,0.0,Neutral,0
didn't really need them for most normal,0.2833333333333333,Positive,1
interactions that i was doing typically,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
i would just open up a web browser or,0.0,Neutral,0
i'd use uh the a vr vr desktop,0.0,Neutral,0
environment for working on my computer i,0.0,Neutral,0
wasn't frequently playing games because,0.1,Positive,1
i'm not much of a vr game player as much,0.2,Positive,1
as a lot of folks and so in my mind the,0.0,Neutral,0
apple vision pro coming without,0.0,Neutral,0
controllers was not the biggest downside,0.0,Neutral,0
in my experience i appreciate the value,0.0,Neutral,0
that controllers drive to the experience,0.0,Neutral,0
of vr if you're specifically playing,0.0,Neutral,0
games but as far as my typical,-0.033333333333333326,Negative,0
interactions with a vr system i don't,0.0,Neutral,0
feel like it's sorely missing the eye,-0.2,Negative,0
tracking on the other hand doesn't feel,-0.125,Negative,0
like it's 100% fully baked on the quest,0.0,Neutral,0
you have the ability to specifically,0.0,Neutral,0
interact with things by pointing at them,0.0,Neutral,0
effectively pointing at them using your,0.6,Positive,1
hands which feels very very natural on,0.13,Positive,1
the apple vision pro you don't have that,0.0,Neutral,0
flexibility whatever you do with your,0.0,Neutral,0
hands is kind of largely ignored save,0.40714285714285714,Positive,1
for the very very few set of,-0.26,Negative,0
interactions of selecting something or,0.0,Neutral,0
dragging something for the most part,0.5,Positive,1
your eye interactions is what drive how,0.0,Neutral,0
you navigate the apple vision pro with,0.0,Neutral,0
some exceptions being actually getting,0.0,Neutral,0
to the home screen that we mentioned,0.0,Neutral,0
beforehand when you are in situation of,0.0,Neutral,0
i have an ipad app basically a few feet,-0.2,Negative,0
from my face and all of the elements are,0.0,Neutral,0
large enough so such that it's very easy,0.1944047619047619,Positive,1
to look at an element pinch my fingers,0.0,Neutral,0
together and know exactly what i'm,0.25,Positive,1
selecting for the most part the,0.5,Positive,1
experience is pretty good it slows down,0.2648148148148148,Positive,1
your experience a little bit when you,-0.1875,Negative,0
are kind of in a flow and all you want,0.6,Positive,1
to do is okay i see an item i'm going to,0.5,Positive,1
click there i see an item i'm going to,0.0,Neutral,0
click there because as soon as you your,0.0,Neutral,0
eyes move before your hands can click,0.0,Neutral,0
that means that you're going to click,0.0,Neutral,0
the wrong item but more frustrating to,-0.13333333333333333,Negative,0
me was in smaller elements environments,0.0,Neutral,0
such as safari web browser when you're,0.0,Neutral,0
browsing the web elements on screen are,0.0,Neutral,0
really not made for this very very broad,-0.009375000000000001,Negative,0
view and so your eye tracking often,0.0,Neutral,0
becomes not precise enough to be able to,0.09999999999999999,Positive,1
interact with something and often it,0.0,Neutral,0
gets slightly slightly offset,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
so if you can imagine trying to look at,0.0,Neutral,0
an element on a screen so for example,0.0,Neutral,0
you're trying to play uh play a or pause,0.0,Neutral,0
music in spotify and you're specifically,0.0,Neutral,0
staring at the play button and you try,0.0,Neutral,0
and squeeze it but unfortunately your,-0.5,Negative,0
eye tracking is just slightly offset so,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
then you skip the track because it's,0.0,Neutral,0
right next to it that interaction gets,0.14285714285714285,Positive,1
very very frustrating and so your only,-0.26,Negative,0
solution is to go through the ey,0.0,Neutral,0
tracking setup process and hope that it,0.0,Neutral,0
solves the the offset issue or to force,0.0,Neutral,0
yourself to look just slightly to the,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
left at the rewind or the last track,0.0,Neutral,0
button and then press it in anticipation,0.0,Neutral,0
of the ey tracking actually thinking,0.0,Neutral,0
you're looking at the play button if,0.0,Neutral,0
this sounds confusing or frustrating,-0.35,Negative,0
that's because it very much is another,0.26,Positive,1
interesting user experience decision is,0.5,Positive,1
the way that vision os allows users to,0.0,Neutral,0
organize,0.0,Neutral,0
applications or i guess the way vision,0.0,Neutral,0
os doesn't allow users to organize,0.0,Neutral,0
applications at all the journey of home,0.0,Neutral,0
screen customization that ios and even,0.0,Neutral,0
ipad os have taken from their inception,0.0,Neutral,0
like original iphone you couldn't move,0.375,Positive,1
anything you're now back to that like,0.0,Neutral,0
we're back to the stone age because,0.0,Neutral,0
basically all of the apps on the home,0.0,Neutral,0
screen are completely static and you,0.5,Positive,1
can't so much as create your own folders,0.4,Positive,1
as you install more apps it will be,0.5,Positive,1
added on to the next page unless they,0.0,Neutral,0
are ipad apps where they live and to a,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
small little compatible apps folder,-0.21875,Negative,0
which is just so bizarre and it feels,0.4,Positive,1
like a very very obvious miss next when,0.0,Neutral,0
organizing your currently open apps in,0.0,Neutral,0
your virtual space apps not in focus,0.0,Neutral,0
become opaque and their volume just,0.0,Neutral,0
automatically lowers now logically this,0.25,Positive,1
makes sense it's like okay well this app,0.5,Positive,1
is falling into the background and so it,0.0,Neutral,0
shouldn't be in focus it should become,0.0,Neutral,0
become opaque but imagine not being able,0.5,Positive,1
to hear your anime lowii girl music in,0.0,Neutral,0
the background while studying because,0.0,Neutral,0
the application is not in focus right,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
obviously when you're watching tv and,0.0,Neutral,0
studying at the same time you'll have,0.0,Neutral,0
the tv offset and you still want it to,0.0,Neutral,0
be visible but in order to make it fully,0.0,Neutral,0
opaque again you need to look back in,0.0,Neutral,0
its direction and squeeze your fingers,0.0,Neutral,0
together in order to watch it and then,0.0,Neutral,0
you have to look back at whatever,0.0,Neutral,0
application you're actually focused on,0.0,Neutral,0
and click it again in order to switch,0.0,Neutral,0
focus back instead of the applications,0.0,Neutral,0
just being all in focus make maybe the,0.0,Neutral,0
biggest thing holding the vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
back though is besides the price the,0.0,Neutral,0
lack of app support now not all ipad,0.0,Neutral,0
apps are compatible which we all just,0.0,Neutral,0
thought oh all ipad apps is going to,0.0,Neutral,0
make this experience so great but even,0.8,Positive,1
those that are technically compatible,0.0,Neutral,0
don't really scale quite often generally,0.125,Positive,1
web apps by the way will scale better so,0.5,Positive,1
often the web apps will be a better,0.5,Positive,1
solution depending on the kind of,0.6,Positive,1
framing and design that you want the app,0.0,Neutral,0
to fall into but worst of all to me is,-1.0,Negative,0
the absence of like dedicated,-0.0125,Negative,0
applications like youtube or hulu or,0.0,Neutral,0
spotify which are some of the most,0.5,Positive,1
popular apps across app stores and and,0.6,Positive,1
some of the apps that i use most,0.5,Positive,1
frequently while it made perfect sense,0.55,Positive,1
for netflix to not design an apple,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro app and a lot of people were,0.0,Neutral,0
very angry about that it's kind of crazy,-0.21666666666666667,Negative,0
to think that hulu also didn't make an,0.0,Neutral,0
apple vision pro app despite being owned,0.0,Neutral,0
by disney who had this exclusive,0.0,Neutral,0
contract with apple vision pro on launch,0.0,Neutral,0
i think i think there's a number of,0.0,Neutral,0
different reasons why a lot of apps are,0.0,Neutral,0
not available yet obviously this is a,-0.1,Negative,0
pretty niche product while apple might,0.25,Positive,1
"have sold a lot in terms of a 3,500",0.0,Neutral,0
unit it's really not quite the volumes,-0.1,Negative,0
that we'd anticipate from every single,-0.07142857142857142,Negative,0
phone sale for example and so in order,0.0,Neutral,0
to kind of motivate a developer to,0.6,Positive,1
develop an app they need to specifically,0.0,Neutral,0
say that this is a halo project of sorts,0.0,Neutral,0
it's even if it doesn't generate a,0.0,Neutral,0
massive amount of users it will drive a,0.0,Neutral,0
lot of interest in this app that people,0.0,Neutral,0
are developing which is why a lot of the,0.0,Neutral,0
applications that you're seeing,0.0,Neutral,0
developed for the apple vision pro are,0.1,Positive,1
from i'll call them no-name developers,0.0,Neutral,0
that don't really have a substantial,0.2,Positive,1
footprint in the app store as it stands,0.0,Neutral,0
and are trying to kind of make their,0.6,Positive,1
name in the apple vision pro application,0.0,Neutral,0
the bottom line is the apple vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
in my minds many folks saw as the savior,0.5,Positive,1
of vr and ar it was clear,0.10000000000000002,Positive,1
a substantially different product than,0.0,Neutral,0
anything that we've ever seen and i,0.0,Neutral,0
think a lot of people hoped that this,0.0,Neutral,0
would kind of bring everyone into this,0.6,Positive,1
new vr space i think in my experience,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
it's not quite happening at the pace,0.0,Neutral,0
that at least i had hoped for the apple,-0.3,Negative,0
vision pro in my mind is the best vr or,1.0,Positive,1
ar headset that i've ever experienced by,0.8,Positive,1
far but that's to be expected,0.0,Neutral,0
considering just how much more expensive,0.0,Neutral,0
it is than other vr headsets on the,-0.125,Negative,0
market it still has as you've seen,0.0,Neutral,0
throughout this video a lot of things,0.0,Neutral,0
that need to be fixed now most of those,0.3,Positive,1
things are fixable but a lot of those,0.0,Neutral,0
things are driven by apple's continued,0.0,Neutral,0
decisions to be different and i don't,0.0,Neutral,0
necessarily think they should be making,0.0,Neutral,0
those constant decisions at least to,-0.15,Negative,0
appease me as someone who purchased a,0.0,Neutral,0
"4,000 headset but i'm curious to know",-0.1,Negative,0
what you think for those who have owned,0.0,Neutral,0
or tested the apple vision pro what do,0.0,Neutral,0
you think of the choice to use such,0.0,Neutral,0
premium hardware at such a mass m,0.0,Neutral,0
expense and what do you think about the,0.0,Neutral,0
user experience i'd love to hear down in,0.17222222222222222,Positive,1
the comments now there will be future,0.0,Neutral,0
videos on our review of the apple vision,0.0,Neutral,0
pro there's a lot of different,0.0,Neutral,0
perspectives i've brought in,0.0,Neutral,0
specifically from being a windows user,0.0,Neutral,0
that i'd like to talk about in a full,0.35,Positive,1
video so be sure to get subscribed if,0.5,Positive,1
you're interested in that thank you for,0.25,Positive,1
watching ino i hope you like this,0.0,Neutral,0
coverage the apple vision pro be sure to,0.5,Positive,1
catch our next coverage coming up soon,0.0,Neutral,0
and all of the other videos that are on,-0.125,Negative,0
our channel which i think you'll find,0.0,Neutral,0
interesting thanks for watching and i'll,0.35,Positive,1
catch you in the next one see you,0.0,Neutral,0
i cannot believe that i am saying this,0.0,Neutral,0
right now but it has been more than a,0.39285714285714285,Positive,1
month since apple launched vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
let's take a look back at the device and,0.0,Neutral,0
ditch the fanboyism,0.0,Neutral,0
and take a real analytical look at,0.2,Positive,1
vision pro how this thing actually holds,0.0,Neutral,0
up after an entire month of use who it's,0.0,Neutral,0
built for and how my opinion has changed,0.0,Neutral,0
let's dive into it i don't need to like,0.0,Neutral,0
re hash the entire design and build of,0.0,Neutral,0
uh vision pro right like you guys have,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
all seen this you already know basically,0.0,Neutral,0
what it is it's a large aluminum body,0.21428571428571427,Positive,1
with a laminated glass front there's a,0.0,Neutral,0
screen in the front that helps to convey,0.0,Neutral,0
where your attention is at any given,0.0,Neutral,0
time it's also a good indicator when,0.7,Positive,1
your device is updating it'll show on,0.0,Neutral,0
that external screen so that's pretty,0.125,Positive,1
cool inside are two gorgeous micro oled,0.5249999999999999,Positive,1
panels they have more pixels than a 4k,0.5,Positive,1
tv each it's power powered by apple's,0.0,Neutral,0
custom m2 and r1 chips the former,0.0,Neutral,0
handles things like graphics and,0.0,Neutral,0
computations and the latter will deal,0.0,Neutral,0
with things like mosa and camera,0.0,Neutral,0
tracking it comes with two straps in the,0.0,Neutral,0
box the solo knit loop and the dual loop,0.0,Neutral,0
band which brings us to a good spot to,0.7,Positive,1
start comfort personally i've struggled,0.0,Neutral,0
with a lot of other headsets and,-0.125,Negative,0
honestly sometimes even glasses like,0.6,Positive,1
i'll put my glasses on and they can hit,0.0,Neutral,0
like right behind my ears and then i end,-0.05714285714285716,Negative,0
up with like terrible headaches headsets,-1.0,Negative,0
do things that are similar as well as,0.0,Neutral,0
giving me pretty terrible bounce of,-0.375,Negative,0
motion sickness while i'm wearing them,0.0,Neutral,0
so going into vision pro i was a little,-0.1875,Negative,0
bit uncertain at how things were going,0.0,Neutral,0
to go when i first demoed vision pro i i,0.25,Positive,1
was a little bit worried i put it on and,-0.1875,Negative,0
right away it felt heavy and after the,0.042857142857142844,Positive,1
end of my 30-minute demo my head,0.0,Neutral,0
definitely hurt but once i got the,0.0,Neutral,0
headset home i was able to play with the,0.5,Positive,1
fit a little bit more so i primarily,0.278125,Positive,1
used the solo knit band and i was able,0.5,Positive,1
to get it on my head into kind of just,0.6,Positive,1
the right spot and i was able to adjust,0.39285714285714285,Positive,1
it really easily with this knob back,0.21666666666666667,Positive,1
here and just find the perfect spot that,1.0,Positive,1
for me was just really comfortable i've,0.4,Positive,1
been able to wear it for hours on end,0.5,Positive,1
without any fatigue no headaches,0.0,Neutral,0
whatsoever i know i may be the outlier,0.0,Neutral,0
here because i know there were a lot of,0.0,Neutral,0
very vocal people that did not have the,0.2,Positive,1
same experience while wearing vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
fortunately apple does include that,0.4,Positive,1
secondary dual loop band and that one,-0.3,Negative,0
was reportedly a lot more comfortable i,0.45,Positive,1
really just stuck with a solo loop,0.2,Positive,1
because it works for me but at least,-0.3,Negative,0
apple has two different options in the,0.0,Neutral,0
box and i'm i doubt it'll be that long,-0.05,Negative,0
before we see some third party bands,0.0,Neutral,0
also coming to market but here i am a,0.0,Neutral,0
month later without a single incident of,-0.03571428571428571,Negative,0
queasiness in the past through video,-0.25,Negative,0
video is so good that at times my brain,0.7,Positive,1
is simply bamboozled to thinking i'm,0.0,Neutral,0
looking at the world around me and not,0.0,Neutral,0
looking at the world through cameras and,0.0,Neutral,0
screens unsurprising to me my favorite,0.5,Positive,1
use case for vision pro so far has been,0.1,Positive,1
consuming media i mean it's truly the,-0.3125,Negative,0
closest thing you can get to actually,0.0,Neutral,0
sitting in a theater at home it's just,0.0,Neutral,0
too easy to get distracted with what's,0.43333333333333335,Positive,1
around you or even just the urge to get,0.0,Neutral,0
up and do something that remembered,0.0,Neutral,0
there on the spot while you're trying to,0.0,Neutral,0
watch a movie or tv show but when your,0.0,Neutral,0
surroundings become slowly obscured by a,-0.30000000000000004,Negative,0
tranquil lake and a large hovering,0.21428571428571427,Positive,1
screen you're just focused and fixated,0.0,Neutral,0
on what you're watching,0.0,Neutral,0
it's it's hard to really put into words,-0.04583333333333334,Negative,0
but for me it makes me feel the media,0.0,Neutral,0
more jump scares in horror movies,0.5,Positive,1
hit harder you can feel dread when a,-0.1,Negative,0
character in an action movie is put into,0.1,Positive,1
peril and the scenery in adventure,0.0,Neutral,0
movies just can literally make my jaw,0.0,Neutral,0
drop until i remind myself to close it,0.0,Neutral,0
this is especially true when watching,0.7,Positive,1
something in 3d there's a wealth of,0.0,Neutral,0
content here but i spent most of my time,0.2,Positive,1
living in the apple tv app as well as in,0.0,Neutral,0
disney plus which also includes my hulu,0.0,Neutral,0
subscription so you know extra perks,0.0,Neutral,0
there don't get me wrong watching videos,-0.5,Negative,0
is not all sunshine and roses there are,0.0,Neutral,0
still downsides you're watching this,0.0,Neutral,0
stuff alone so if you want to share that,0.0,Neutral,0
experience with someone you can't while,0.0,Neutral,0
wearing vision pro and honestly that's a,0.6,Positive,1
huge downside that can really be a make,0.30000000000000004,Positive,1
or break experience for someone some,0.0,Neutral,0
apps still have also not yet been,0.0,Neutral,0
optimized so much so that apple puts,0.2,Positive,1
them into their own special folder on,0.47857142857142854,Positive,1
your home screen not living with the,0.0,Neutral,0
rest of the vision os apps one of the,0.0,Neutral,0
biggest ones is amazon prime video this,0.0,Neutral,0
is literally just the ipad app and when,0.0,Neutral,0
you're watching a video it has big old,0.05,Positive,1
black bars on the top and the bottom,0.16666666666666669,Positive,1
just kind of kills the experience a,0.6,Positive,1
little bit what's worse some apps are,-0.29375,Negative,0
relegated to the browser,0.0,Neutral,0
netflix sorry i was just coughing a,-0.5,Negative,0
little bit uh but it would really,0.0062500000000000056,Positive,1
behoove apple to get more of these big,0.25,Positive,1
media companies to play nice to develop,0.6,Positive,1
these apps for vision pro to really,0.2,Positive,1
become the media powerhouse it it could,0.0,Neutral,0
be i thought the speakers on vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
were pretty solid they were above,0.08333333333333333,Positive,1
average for a headset set of speakers,-0.15,Negative,0
and they sold the spatial audio pretty,0.25,Positive,1
well i still prefer airpods and if,0.0,Neutral,0
you're trying to like watch this in bed,0.0,Neutral,0
the spatial speakers can get really,0.2,Positive,1
messed up if you're trying to like lay,0.0,Neutral,0
on a pillow so yeah i found myself just,0.0,Neutral,0
using airpods more often than not but i,0.5,Positive,1
wasn't sad with how good the speakers on,0.09999999999999998,Positive,1
the headset actually were one of the,0.0,Neutral,0
things i'm really interested in that,0.25,Positive,1
hasn't had a lot of discussion around it,0.0,Neutral,0
is apple's plans for future immersive,0.0,Neutral,0
content apple has several shorts already,0.0,Neutral,0
available in like the tv app there's,0.4,Positive,1
like alicia keys and a highwire one and,0.0,Neutral,0
they look amazing i mean they completely,0.12916666666666668,Positive,1
like surround you they completely fill,0.1,Positive,1
your field of view and they're really,0.2,Positive,1
really cool but there's only a few of,0.04999999999999999,Positive,1
them so far and apple hasn't talked,0.1,Positive,1
about how it makes these or future plans,0.0,Neutral,0
to make more of them or where we'll be,0.5,Positive,1
able to see more immersive video like,0.5,Positive,1
that i think this is really cool and if,0.35,Positive,1
apple could expand the production of,0.0,Neutral,0
these maybe making any of its original,0.375,Positive,1
content in this form factor that beyond,0.0,Neutral,0
a couple minute short i think it would,0.0,Neutral,0
be really great as i was loving that,0.7,Positive,1
massive big screen experience with,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro it of course had me,0.0,Neutral,0
considering the gaming ramifications,0.0,Neutral,0
here this was probably the biggest mix,0.0,Neutral,0
bag of of the entire experience for me,0.0,Neutral,0
it seems confusing not easy and i'm not,-0.2583333333333333,Negative,0
really sure apple considers vision pro,0.5,Positive,1
an actual gaming device as it stands now,0.0,Neutral,0
unlike with other vr headsets apple,-0.125,Negative,0
doesn't include any motion controllers,0.0,Neutral,0
so your options are either pair a,0.0,Neutral,0
console controller like the dual sense,0.0,Neutral,0
or use your hands your hands are fine,0.4166666666666667,Positive,1
for the likes of apple arcade stalwarts,0.0,Neutral,0
like fruit ninja jetpack joy ride or,0.8,Positive,1
lego journey but you're not going to be,0.0,Neutral,0
able to do much more those are still,0.5,Positive,1
basically flat 2ti games with some,-0.025,Negative,0
spatial elements going on there is game,-0.4,Negative,0
room which is kind of cool you can play,0.475,Positive,1
chess in 3d space but again it felt kind,0.6,Positive,1
of limiting to me and i grew tired of it,-0.4,Negative,0
pretty quick you know hand controls are,0.29166666666666663,Positive,1
great for browsing the web i just just,0.8,Positive,1
don't think finger guns are going to,0.0,Neutral,0
work in borderlands there's also a,0.0,Neutral,0
distinct lack of co-presence multiplayer,0.3,Positive,1
games that's basically for those who,0.0,Neutral,0
don't know when you are kind of like,0.6,Positive,1
occupying the same 3d space together and,0.0,Neutral,0
playing with other people and without,-0.125,Negative,0
that i think it's really going to hurt,0.2,Positive,1
gaming even more so how do you get other,0.1875,Positive,1
games onto vision pro for me i used an,0.0,Neutral,0
app called mirror playay which allowed,0.0,Neutral,0
me to mirror my playstation 5 into the,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro sony actually blocked its own,0.3,Positive,1
remote play application from appearing,-0.1,Negative,0
on vision pro so this is as closer going,0.0,Neutral,0
to get to a first party solution here,0.25,Positive,1
this works surprisingly well and other,0.2875,Positive,1
than the occasional lag was probably the,0.0,Neutral,0
best gaming experience i've had i prefer,1.0,Positive,1
this over a big tv plus faith can watch,0.0,Neutral,0
her tv shows or harrison can watch his,0.0,Neutral,0
shows while i'm still able to game,0.04999999999999999,Positive,1
inside a vision pro there are other,-0.125,Negative,0
streaming options too like geforce now,0.0,Neutral,0
or steam play or sunlight moonlight uh,0.0,Neutral,0
but these streaming games are still just,0.0,Neutral,0
not the same thing as a vr immersive 360,0.0,Neutral,0
degree game frankly it's things like,-0.4,Negative,0
this on the software side that seem to,0.0,Neutral,0
be holding vision pro back the most it's,0.25,Positive,1
not like it's bad and the groundwork,-0.6999999999999998,Negative,0
that apple has laid so far is absolutely,0.15000000000000002,Positive,1
astonishing it's very impressive but,0.75,Positive,1
it's also like it's missing some basic,-0.1,Negative,0
stuff like rearranging your app icons,0.0,Neutral,0
yeah don't you dare try to do that no,0.0,Neutral,0
they're going to be in alphabetical,0.0,Neutral,0
order and you are going to like it i do,0.0,Neutral,0
like the eye tracking and the finger,0.0,Neutral,0
gestures it it feels very natural i like,0.13,Positive,1
that i can rest my hands down at my side,-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
on a desk on my lap and i don't have to,0.0,Neutral,0
be like wildly waving them in the air to,0.1,Positive,1
actually interact and do things i can,0.0,Neutral,0
just keep them at my side and interact,0.0,Neutral,0
as i need to it feels less intimidating,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
and less intrusive personas if you if,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
you haven't heard about those took a lot,0.0,Neutral,0
of heat with the initial version of,0.0,Neutral,0
vision os um but vision os 1.1 which is,0.0,Neutral,0
currently in beta testing looks to,0.0,Neutral,0
improve these personas even more which,0.5,Positive,1
is which is very good personally i don't,0.45499999999999996,Positive,1
think mine looks half bad for me right,-0.1936507936507936,Negative,0
now on the beta what seems like the,0.0,Neutral,0
biggest killer is like the eyes they,0.0,Neutral,0
don't emote like i smile and my eyes,0.3,Positive,1
don't move it does a decent job with my,0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
hair even but yeah for me it's always,0.0,Neutral,0
the eyes as as the giveaway for it but i,0.0,Neutral,0
still prefer you know this persona,0.0,Neutral,0
versus the animated ones that you have,0.0,Neutral,0
on the quest i think does have a lot of,0.0,Neutral,0
ground to make up here and hopefully,0.0,Neutral,0
apple gives us a preview of vision os2,0.0,Neutral,0
at wwdc so fingers crossed for that for,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro to be someone's primary,0.4,Positive,1
computing device it needs to do more,0.5,Positive,1
than just entertain you with movies and,0.0,Neutral,0
tv and games it needs to also lend,0.0,Neutral,0
itself to productivity productivity is,0.0,Neutral,0
the third leg that i think vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
basically needs to stand on don't get me,0.0,Neutral,0
wrong i think vision pro can be a single,-0.2857142857142857,Negative,0
use device like i don't see anything,0.0,Neutral,0
wrong with that in fact you might have,-0.5,Negative,0
seen me do an entire dedicated video to,0.0,Neutral,0
why i think vision pro is a good,0.7,Positive,1
replacement for like a,0.0,Neutral,0
"4,000 tv but for",0.0,Neutral,0
most to justify the price i think it has,0.5,Positive,1
to do more i think mileage will vary but,0.5,Positive,1
for me vision pro just wasn't productive,0.0,Neutral,0
enough on its own like i can't edit,0.3,Positive,1
videos in final cup pro i can't edit,0.0,Neutral,0
photos in affinity photo or photoshop,0.0,Neutral,0
and even apple's own photo app lacks,0.6,Positive,1
basic editing capabilities the one thing,0.0,Neutral,0
i could do was write articles assuming i,0.0,Neutral,0
paired a keyboard with it i wasn't about,0.0,Neutral,0
to dict tape or chicken type with my,-0.6,Negative,0
fingers in the air entire articles and,0.0,Neutral,0
posts inside a vision pro i could work,0.0,Neutral,0
in google docs microsoft office suite is,0.0,Neutral,0
also here if if that's more your thing,0.5,Positive,1
but uh i could do that just just fine,0.4166666666666667,Positive,1
but i i'm not paying,0.0,Neutral,0
3500 to edit google docs on the moon,0.0,Neutral,0
what ended up working for me was pairing,0.0,Neutral,0
my vision pro with my mac it ends up,0.0,Neutral,0
with this blended unique experience that,0.375,Positive,1
did help improve my,0.0,Neutral,0
productivity while also adding at least,-0.3,Negative,0
",000 to your purchase price here to fit",0.4,Positive,1
my workflow i positioned my mac display,0.0,Neutral,0
in the middle with anary windows,0.0,Neutral,0
surrounding it my twitter client hovers,0.0,Neutral,0
here to the left while i put things like,0.0,Neutral,0
the news over on the right for those of,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
you who don't know i also have a little,-0.1875,Negative,0
one and uh we still use a baby monitor,0.0,Neutral,0
we use it to watch him in his bed it's,0.0,Neutral,0
called cradle wise and funny enough it's,0.31666666666666665,Positive,1
available here on vision pro so i can,0.4,Positive,1
work watch tv and also have a live feed,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
of the baby monitor going all at once,0.0,Neutral,0
niche yeah but it's so freaking cool so,0.35,Positive,1
that brings us to the story of apps on,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro now the flow of new apps has,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
slowed down from the steady stream that,0.005555555555555536,Positive,1
we saw upon release but there are still,0.0,Neutral,0
some pretty cool new apps that have,0.24545454545454545,Positive,1
dropped recently since the vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
launched apple will happily jump at the,0.8,Positive,1
chance to tell you that there are more,0.5,Positive,1
than a million ipad apps that are,0.0,Neutral,0
compatible with vision pro and while,0.0,Neutral,0
that's true they don't always translate,0.35,Positive,1
the best sometimes they're just a little,0.40625,Positive,1
weird or wonky sometimes they're buggy,-0.4,Negative,0
and at best they seem like a stop gap,1.0,Positive,1
solution there are some great handouts,0.8,Positive,1
though dusk is a great twitter client,0.8,Positive,1
tik tok has gone native bitmaps provides,0.0,Neutral,0
these tiny spatially optimize apple map,0.0,Neutral,0
pieces typos mirrors your iphone,0.0,Neutral,0
keyboard for better text entry and of,0.5,Positive,1
course i already mentioned microsoft,0.0,Neutral,0
office fantastical is here things these,0.0,Neutral,0
are all massive mac apps that have made,0.0,Neutral,0
their way to vision pro in a native,0.0,Neutral,0
spatial app and they're great i just,0.8,Positive,1
want to see more big name apps make the,0.25,Positive,1
jump sooner rather than later and any,0.0,Neutral,0
feature updates to some apple apps also,0.0,Neutral,0
wouldn't be unwelcomed either apple has,0.0,Neutral,0
had kind of a rough year when it comes,0.25,Positive,1
to developer relations between changes,0.0,Neutral,0
in the eu and app store lawsuits so i i,0.0,Neutral,0
really hope i don't have to wait like a,0.2,Positive,1
year to get some more powerful,0.4,Positive,1
productivity apps or vr style games on,0.0,Neutral,0
the vision pro here's the thing when,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro is good it's really really,0.44999999999999996,Positive,1
good i started to ask myself at the end,0.7,Positive,1
of all of this despite the negatives,0.0,Neutral,0
that i have gone over are there things i,0.0,Neutral,0
would rather do in vision pro that i,0.0,Neutral,0
can't or don't want to do with my other,-0.125,Negative,0
devices that i already have would i,0.0,Neutral,0
rather do things with this just strapped,0.0,Neutral,0
to my face and after some time more and,0.5,Positive,1
more the answer,0.5,Positive,1
became yes yeah there are a lot of,0.0,Neutral,0
negatives here here but that doesn't,0.0,Neutral,0
mean it's a bad product i think apple is,-0.5062499999999999,Negative,0
on the right track and the more i use it,0.39285714285714285,Positive,1
the more i love the experiences that it,0.5,Positive,1
provides i love being able to work in,0.5,Positive,1
such a large spatial landscape i love,0.2380952380952381,Positive,1
being able to watch movies and tv here,0.5,Positive,1
versus on my tv and even games are cool,0.35,Positive,1
though i still wish we had some actual,0.0,Neutral,0
vr style titles but there is so much,0.2,Positive,1
potential with this device frankly it's,0.0,Neutral,0
got me excited again what do you guys,0.375,Positive,1
think of vision pro do you think apple,0.0,Neutral,0
did great on a first gen product or do,0.525,Positive,1
you think it still has a lot more to do,0.5,Positive,1
before it should have brought this to,0.0,Neutral,0
market let me know down below in the,-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
comments you can also let me know on,0.0,Neutral,0
twitter at andrew u or over on threads,0.0,Neutral,0
at andro hera 941 always stay tuned got,0.0,Neutral,0
a lot more coverage coming your way,0.5,Positive,1
yo what's going on guys this is wi and,0.0,Neutral,0
welcome back to another video today i'm,0.4,Positive,1
super excited because we are unboxing,0.35416666666666663,Positive,1
the brand new apple vision pro i just,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
picked this up from the apple store,0.0,Neutral,0
moments ago as well as some accessories,0.0,Neutral,0
for it too so we will be checking out,0.0,Neutral,0
everything inside the box as well as,0.0,Neutral,0
doing a live demo and putting on the,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
headset for the very first time when i,0.325,Positive,1
went to the apple store they actually,0.0,Neutral,0
offered to do a whole demo and unboxing,0.2,Positive,1
there in the store so i could get used,0.0,Neutral,0
to it but i said no i just want to take,0.0,Neutral,0
it home as is we'll do the unboxing and,0.0,Neutral,0
be putting the headset on for the very,0.2,Positive,1
first time right here in the studio this,0.26785714285714285,Positive,1
is a 1 tbte version by the way they,0.0,Neutral,0
offered 256 but when we pre-ordered we,0.0,Neutral,0
saw there was also a 512 gig and a,0.0,Neutral,0
terabyte version as well and they,0.0,Neutral,0
weren't much more expensive than the 256,0.0,Neutral,0
so it kind of made the larger storage,0.3,Positive,1
options seem like a no-brainer,0.0,Neutral,0
especially when you are spending so much,0.1,Positive,1
money on this already this is a first,0.25,Positive,1
generation product so it can be a little,-0.1875,Negative,0
nerve-wracking when you're buying,0.0,Neutral,0
something that no one has ever tried,0.0,Neutral,0
before but when i saw these,0.0,Neutral,0
demonstrations of it it it just looks so,0.0,Neutral,0
so incredible that i thought you know i,0.9,Positive,1
think that's for me and i'm willing to,0.25,Positive,1
invest and try it out so we'll be doing,0.0,Neutral,0
that here today so here we go without,0.0,Neutral,0
further ado we have this gargantuan box,-0.025,Negative,0
of a product says vision pro on the side,0.0,Neutral,0
and of course in true apple fashion we,0.35,Positive,1
have a couple pull tabs so let's get,0.0,Neutral,0
this thing open there's,0.0,Neutral,0
one,0.0,Neutral,0
ooh,0.0,Neutral,0
okay,0.5,Positive,1
man i'm so nervous i saw a couple,0.0,Neutral,0
headsets in the store i wanted to try,0.0,Neutral,0
them on so badly but i,-0.6999999999999998,Negative,0
really i really wanted to save the first,0.225,Positive,1
impressions for right now oh dude it,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
smells so good it smells like you just,0.7,Positive,1
opened a brand new box of like sneakers,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
or something it's got that like new car,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
smell you know so here's the headset,0.0,Neutral,0
first and foremost right outside of the,0.17857142857142858,Positive,1
box let's set that to the side we can,0.0,Neutral,0
talk about more about that in just a,0.5,Positive,1
moment underneath this insert we have,0.0,Neutral,0
some of the packaging the polishing,0.0,Neutral,0
cloth we also have an alternate band,0.0,Neutral,0
that we'll talk about here we have the,0.0,Neutral,0
dual loop,0.0,Neutral,0
band oh nice it's like a really good,0.6499999999999999,Positive,1
like starter,0.0,Neutral,0
guide,0.0,Neutral,0
impressive we have a polishing cloth,1.0,Positive,1
that is specifically for the vision,0.0,Neutral,0
pro and i believe this cloth actually,0.0,Neutral,0
says vision pro on it it,0.0,Neutral,0
does we have a light seal,0.4,Positive,1
cushion this comes with one already on,0.0,Neutral,0
the headset as well as a second cushion,0.0,Neutral,0
and this is obviously to block out the,0.0,Neutral,0
light and it fits you know to your face,0.4,Positive,1
when i pre-ordered it i actually had my,0.0,Neutral,0
iphone out at 5:00 a.m. when pre-orders,0.0,Neutral,0
went live and i scanned my whole face,0.16818181818181818,Positive,1
and it kind of took some like augmented,0.6,Positive,1
measurements and then it actually,0.0,Neutral,0
recommended some sizing of the headset,0.0,Neutral,0
set the light shields and everything for,0.4,Positive,1
my face so you know in a way you could,0.0,Neutral,0
almost believe that this is uh kind of,0.6,Positive,1
like personalized to the shape of my,0.0,Neutral,0
face here is the dual loop band and this,0.0,Neutral,0
is probably the band that we'll be,0.0,Neutral,0
trying some people have said that the,0.0,Neutral,0
headset is a little bit heavy uh but,-0.19375,Negative,0
this band actually goes around the back,0.0,Neutral,0
and the top of your head to help kind of,0.55,Positive,1
bear some of that weight since this is,0.0,Neutral,0
such a front heavy headset and last but,-0.06666666666666667,Negative,0
not least we actually get a fairly small,-0.03333333333333333,Negative,0
block i believe this is a 30 watt block,0.0,Neutral,0
um we get a braided usbc cord and then,0.0,Neutral,0
we have this battery now wait yo first,0.25,Positive,1
impressions after watching so much,0.2,Positive,1
content on youtube this battery feels,0.0,Neutral,0
and looks a lot smaller than i thought,0.0,Neutral,0
um this looked way bigger than it really,0.1,Positive,1
is all right now let's talk about the,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
main attraction this is the headset and,0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
it really doesn't actually feel that,0.1,Positive,1
heavy man i was really hoping that,0.0,Neutral,0
everyone's saying oh this headset's so,0.0,Neutral,0
heavy it doesn't feel that bad but then,-0.44999999999999996,Negative,0
again wearing it on your face for like 2,0.0,Neutral,0
hours that's a different story so we we,0.0,Neutral,0
have this kind of cover to protect the,0.6,Positive,1
front which is all glass so let's take,0.0,Neutral,0
this off for the first,0.25,Positive,1
time there we go that is the front of,0.0,Neutral,0
the vision pro and we have additional,0.0,Neutral,0
packaging on the inside as well couple,0.0,Neutral,0
pull tabs here on the side and this,0.0,Neutral,0
insert should come,0.0,Neutral,0
out and there it is ladies and gentlemen,0.0,Neutral,0
the apple vision,0.0,Neutral,0
pro now it comes with the solo knit band,0.0,Neutral,0
um which a lot of people have been,0.0,Neutral,0
wearing oh that's interesting it looks,0.5,Positive,1
like it popped right off it probably,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
shouldn't do,0.0,Neutral,0
that there we go i don't think it was i,0.0,Neutral,0
don't think it was popped in,0.0,Neutral,0
correctly so the solo knit band is the,0.0,Neutral,0
one that most people have worn in their,0.5,Positive,1
demos as well as you know the marketing,0.0,Neutral,0
and the trailers for the device however,0.0,Neutral,0
i kind of want to try out this dual loop,0.6,Positive,1
band for the reasons i mentioned before,0.0,Neutral,0
just for kind of distributing more of,0.55,Positive,1
the weight over the top of your head on,0.5,Positive,1
the side we also have this is the audio,0.0,Neutral,0
so it kind of just projects it right,0.44285714285714284,Positive,1
down down into your ears and we have,-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
that first um light shield already,0.325,Positive,1
installed now this does come out um with,0.0,Neutral,0
a pretty simple just like,0.125,Positive,1
magnetic just kind of snaps into place,0.6,Positive,1
but it's not that strong so you don't,0.4333333333333333,Positive,1
want to be grabbing it because if you,0.0,Neutral,0
know you could pop out and actually drop,0.0,Neutral,0
the headset which you do not want to do,0.0,Neutral,0
let's talk about accessories before we,0.0,Neutral,0
put it on i'm dying to try this but we,0.0,Neutral,0
just got a little bit more to go next up,0.10416666666666667,Positive,1
we have the balon battery holder for,0.0,Neutral,0
apple vision pro i saw it on the site i,0.0,Neutral,0
was not that expensive i think it was,-0.5,Negative,0
49.99 and pops the battery on you know,0.0,Neutral,0
you could either wear it in your pocket,0.0,Neutral,0
or you could also just clip it to this,0.0,Neutral,0
um because you're going to have to take,0.0,Neutral,0
the battery around with you if you want,0.0,Neutral,0
to use the apple vision pro you know,0.0,Neutral,0
outside or whatnot we also have and i,0.0,Neutral,0
think this thing is really cool not sure,0.04999999999999999,Positive,1
if it was worth 200 but we have the,0.3,Positive,1
vision pro case this looks like it was,0.0,Neutral,0
designed by nasa this is like something,0.0,Neutral,0
you'd see on a space shuttle so we can,0.0,Neutral,0
kind of hold it like that it has a,0.6,Positive,1
handle and on the inside um i will admit,0.0,Neutral,0
it's very very soft and it's very,0.165,Positive,1
cushioned this is a really unique design,0.375,Positive,1
i think this kind of like airbag uh,0.6,Positive,1
compresses slowly so should you drop it,-0.30000000000000004,Negative,0
uh it kind of fills up like a balloon,0.6,Positive,1
but i think that would really really,0.2,Positive,1
cushion a fall and obviously protect,0.0,Neutral,0
your headset on the inside which is,0.0,Neutral,0
quite the investment,0.0,Neutral,0
so so it has a spot for your battery um,0.0,Neutral,0
the headset will go around here and then,0.0,Neutral,0
it has this cool little bag in the,0.08124999999999999,Positive,1
middle that you could store like the,0.0,Neutral,0
charging block as well as,0.0,Neutral,0
the cords and everything for the headset,0.0,Neutral,0
itself so this is a proprietary,0.0,Neutral,0
connector that only apple makes um you,0.0,Neutral,0
know which is very common of apple to do,-0.39,Negative,0
it goes into the side here and it will,0.0,Neutral,0
lock into,0.0,Neutral,0
place and then clicks down there it is,-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
you see a light start to pulse here that,0.4,Positive,1
lets us know that it's on and here we go,0.0,Neutral,0
the moment of truth for the very first,0.325,Positive,1
time i am putting one of these on my,0.0,Neutral,0
head i hope it was worth it,0.3,Positive,1
okay so obviously i can't see anything,0.25,Positive,1
now what i'm going to do here uh it's a,0.0,Neutral,0
little bit loose i'm going to tighten,-0.13221153846153846,Negative,0
this,0.0,Neutral,0
band nice and,0.6,Positive,1
snug okay this really is not that bad,-0.09999999999999994,Negative,0
man it's not that,0.0,Neutral,0
heavy oh here we go okay so in a moment,0.15,Positive,1
i will mirror this and be able to record,0.5,Positive,1
it so that you guys can see what i see,0.0,Neutral,0
but until i get through the setup,0.0,Neutral,0
process i'm not going to be able to,0.5,Positive,1
share this startup experience so i'll,0.0,Neutral,0
try to do my best to explain it to you,1.0,Positive,1
guys so right now all black all i see is,0.05952380952380952,Positive,1
kind of a headset like,0.6,Positive,1
outline she said triple click the,0.0,Neutral,0
digital crown for voiceover so i can,0.0,Neutral,0
hold and align the the eye pieces uh,0.0,Neutral,0
depending on,0.0,Neutral,0
how wide or narrow my eyes are set okay,0.06666666666666665,Positive,1
good green check mark all,0.24999999999999997,Positive,1
right now we've just got it oh my,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
god,0.0,Neutral,0
this is insane dude i l i just see my,-1.0,Negative,0
studio holy crap it just did a giant,-0.4,Negative,0
hello like in the middle of my studio,0.0,Neutral,0

heck i i i literally feel like i'm just,0.0,Neutral,0
in my,0.0,Neutral,0
studio so this is not a there's nothing,0.0,Neutral,0
transparent about this at all um i can't,0.0,Neutral,0
see through it what's happening is,0.0,Neutral,0
there's cameras on the outside screens,0.0,Neutral,0
on the inside so the cameras are,0.0,Neutral,0
recording everything and in like literal,0.0,Neutral,0
real time it's displaying it to the eye,0.2,Positive,1
pieces wow all right here we are we're,0.19285714285714284,Positive,1
in it for the very first time we can,0.325,Positive,1
pinch and see all of our different apps,0.0,Neutral,0
i really want to try very first thing,0.2625,Positive,1
they kept showing these,0.0,Neutral,0
environments so let's see we've got like,0.0,Neutral,0
hawaii joshua tree couple of them are,0.0,Neutral,0
coming soon mount hood yos ooh,0.0,Neutral,0

whoa so we still got a little bit of,-0.1875,Negative,0
like you can kind of see on the sides of,0.6,Positive,1
my studio but if we turn this dial on,0.0,Neutral,0
the top we can go fully like,0.5,Positive,1
100% wow this is actually,0.05,Positive,1

it's so like i looked up and i'm like oh,0.0,Neutral,0
that's the moon and then i realized oh,0.0,Neutral,0
wait i'm on the moon so we look up with,0.0,Neutral,0
this arrow and we can uh go back to our,0.0,Neutral,0
we can bring our apps up so we can uh if,0.0,Neutral,0
i click this we can like realign our,0.0,Neutral,0
apps right here there we go so i can,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
just sit back and we can relax here like,0.0,Neutral,0
literally on the moon let's open the,0.0,Neutral,0
apps let's open uh a,0.0,Neutral,0
note let's mess around with some typing,-0.175,Negative,0
so let's look there and it brings up a,0.0,Neutral,0
virtual keyboard so i can type in a,0.0,Neutral,0
multitude of ways we can go h e l l o,0.0,Neutral,0
it's pretty fast oh i accidentally did,0.225,Positive,1
another,0.0,Neutral,0
o i'm kind of curious to see how fast we,0.2333333333333333,Positive,1

in even any of the other tech demos that,-0.125,Negative,0
i've watched i've watched almost every,0.0,Neutral,0
single video that's on the apple vision,-0.07142857142857142,Negative,0
pro nobody showed this that's so cool so,0.35,Positive,1
instead of having to like look up there,0.0,Neutral,0
and down here we can also just make this,-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
note like we can shrink it we can uh we,0.0,Neutral,0
can bring it kind of close we could even,0.6,Positive,1
have it like right here like a little,0.04910714285714285,Positive,1
you know like a keyboard monitor this is,0.0,Neutral,0
just like typing on a real,0.2,Positive,1
computer there you go the easy as that,0.43333333333333335,Positive,1
that's that is insane and then we could,-1.0,Negative,0
take this we could be like you know i,0.0,Neutral,0
want that back there and we can make it,0.0,Neutral,0
bigger oh my god dude it's just like all,0.0,Neutral,0
right there are you kidding kidding,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
me this is crazy last thing we got to,-0.3,Negative,0
try out the the encounter dinosaurs okay,0.5,Positive,1
oh here we go i've seen this this is,0.0,Neutral,0
cool oh,0.35,Positive,1
yo that's so,0.0,Neutral,0
cool,0.35,Positive,1
whoa whoa whoa,0.0,Neutral,0
whoa,0.0,Neutral,0
okay look how it's like 3d i can move,0.5,Positive,1
and you can see more of the surrounding,0.5,Positive,1
area oh look at that there little boy,-0.1875,Negative,0
hey big guy oh i was going to say,0.0,Neutral,0
where's your mama,0.0,Neutral,0
no,0.0,Neutral,0
oh oh did he go hide in the rock oh,0.0,Neutral,0
yo oh hell no oh okay this actually,0.25,Positive,1
mildly,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
terrifying,-1.0,Negative,0
okay okay um my body is doing that thing,0.5,Positive,1
where it's like,0.0,Neutral,0
run all right we're back we're creating,0.14285714285714285,Positive,1
our,0.0,Neutral,0
persona i'm really really excited to see,0.375,Positive,1
these results it's going to be super,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
goofy so this is for when you want to,0.5,Positive,1
facetime or have your own avatar but,0.6,Positive,1
obviously you can't capture your face,0.0,Neutral,0
when the thing is on your face so let's,0.0,Neutral,0
let's see how it looks oh dear god bro,0.0,Neutral,0
what is,0.0,Neutral,0
that all right i might have to remake my,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
persona when i don't have the uh like,0.0,Neutral,0
the lines on my head cuz clearly wearing,0.10000000000000002,Positive,1
the thing for a while it's put some,0.0,Neutral,0
marks on,0.0,Neutral,0
actually,0.0,Neutral,0
wow i'm not going to lie it looked weird,-0.2,Negative,0
at first but now i'm,0.25,Positive,1
like that's really good that's like,0.7,Positive,1
scary,-0.5,Negative,0
good that's so crazy and the cameras on,0.04999999999999999,Positive,1
the bottom can see my mouth like i,0.0,Neutral,0
actually don't hate,-0.8,Negative,0
it okay i have your reaction yo,0.5,Positive,1
hi it's not that weird right it's really,-0.004761904761904763,Negative,0
not that bad all right so 100% without a,-0.20714285714285707,Negative,0
doubt one of the biggest things that,0.0,Neutral,0
made me say yeah i got to buy the vision,0.0,Neutral,0
pro was its functionality with a mac so,0.0,Neutral,0
check this out we can have a full works,0.35,Positive,1
space take this small laptop and blow it,-0.25,Negative,0
up to a massive display within the,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro headset so if we go ahead and,0.0,Neutral,0
open this,0.0,Neutral,0
mac i can look up in the sky we can open,0.0,Neutral,0
control center and do a mac connection,-0.1,Negative,0
winds macbook,0.0,Neutral,0
pro now in a second our mac will go,0.0,Neutral,0
black and you'll see boom all of a,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
sudden hd display we can also use the,0.0,Neutral,0
magic trackpad the magic keyboard we,0.5,Positive,1
could open a tab here we could even go,0.0,Neutral,0
to,0.0,Neutral,0
youtube.com we can check out tim cook,0.0,Neutral,0
talks new apple vision,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
pro now it's funny enough is that the,0.125,Positive,1
sound is actually coming out of the max,0.2,Positive,1
so i'm sure there's a way for us to get,0.5,Positive,1
it to go through the vision pro headset,0.0,Neutral,0
but you guys can probably already see,0.0,Neutral,0
the vision no pun intended we can put it,0.0,Neutral,0
i feel like i'm working in front of a 35,0.0,Neutral,0
40 in computer screen and that's not,0.0,Neutral,0
even the craziest part we can also open,0.0,Neutral,0
uh another window if we wanted we could,0.0,Neutral,0
uh you know let's go to our apps apps we,0.0,Neutral,0
could probably open like,0.0,Neutral,0
music now we've got that we can open,0.0,Neutral,0
this uh move it to the side this is,0.0,Neutral,0
without a doubt one of the uh one of the,0.0,Neutral,0
main things i wanted to try out and,0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
imagine like video editing and then,0.0,Neutral,0
you've got like maybe your your group,0.0,Neutral,0
chat here with your buddies and maybe,0.0,Neutral,0
you're watching like a basketball game,-0.4,Negative,0
on the side but this right here i think,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
it's now it's expensive don't get me,-0.5,Negative,0
wrong a mac and a vision pro is going to,-0.5,Negative,0
set you back a pretty significant amount,0.20833333333333334,Positive,1
of money but if you already had a mac,0.0,Neutral,0
then maybe the vision pro doesn't seem,0.0,Neutral,0
like such a crazy um investment to make,-0.3,Negative,0
knowing that boom you can get this and,0.0,Neutral,0
if you had any privacy concerns um no,0.0,Neutral,0
one can even see what you're working on,0.0,Neutral,0
because look at that your mac is blacked,0.0,Neutral,0
out i think that's going to do it for a,0.0,Neutral,0
uh very successful first part of trying,0.6125,Positive,1
out the apple vision pro now make sure,0.5,Positive,1
you guys do like and subscribe because,0.0,Neutral,0
we will have a follow-up video that is,0.0,Neutral,0
testing out games not only games for the,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro we also have ipad and iphone,0.0,Neutral,0
games that are compatible that can run,0.0,Neutral,0
inside of the vision pro and anything,0.0,Neutral,0
else we can try to figure out to do with,0.0,Neutral,0
it as well maybe games that aren't,0.0,Neutral,0
compatible but you could probably mirror,0.0,Neutral,0
it to your mac put the mac on the big,0.0,Neutral,0
screen and and then boom you can play,0.0,Neutral,0
that way as well there really feels like,0.2,Positive,1
there's no limits when it comes to,0.0,Neutral,0
trying to figure out ways to work with,0.0,Neutral,0
the vision pro so we will try that out,0.0,Neutral,0
in the next video playing some games,0.0,Neutral,0
make sure you guys subscribe so you,0.5,Positive,1
don't miss that one and thank you for,0.0,Neutral,0
watching this pretty lengthy unboxing,0.25,Positive,1
but this is an incredible piece of,0.9,Positive,1
technology we have hardly scratched the,-0.2916666666666667,Negative,0
surface so i'm very excited to really,0.34375,Positive,1
dig in and see what else we can do with,0.0,Neutral,0
it but that's all i have for you guys,0.0,Neutral,0
today thank you so much for watching and,0.2,Positive,1
i will see you guys next time,0.0,Neutral,0
music,0.0,Neutral,0
music,0.0,Neutral,0
hey everybody it's norm from tested and,0.0,Neutral,0
well it's about time today i'm going to,0.0,Neutral,0
be sharing my review and deep dive into,0.0,Neutral,0
the apple vision pro as i'm recording,0.0,Neutral,0
this for about a month since it's,0.0,Neutral,0
release since people have actually been,0.0,Neutral,0
able to buy it and use it i've been,0.5,Positive,1
personally using and testing it for the,0.0,Neutral,0
past couple weeks and want to throw my,-0.25,Negative,0
voice out there as well someone who's,0.0,Neutral,0
been testing and using headsets for well,0.0,Neutral,0
over 10 years now uh my thoughts my,0.0,Neutral,0
opinions and to dive deep into the,0.0,Neutral,0
hardware for those of you who may not be,0.0,Neutral,0
following this as deeply as those of us,0.0,Neutral,0
who are obsessed with vr and mixed,-0.25,Negative,0
reality today uh now since it's launch,0.0,Neutral,0
there have been plenty of reviews i've,0.0,Neutral,0
read and watched them with eager,0.0,Neutral,0
anticipation at launch as well but the,0.0,Neutral,0
community and the user base has learned,-0.8,Negative,0
so much about the apple vision pro since,0.2,Positive,1
it's launched there have been new,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
applications betas for the software and,0.0,Neutral,0
things and quirks and features that only,0.0,Neutral,0
after using it for so long that we feel,-0.05,Negative,0
like it's actually worth discussing and,0.3,Positive,1
even then it feels like the beginning of,0.0,Neutral,0
something and while it certainly isn't,0.21428571428571427,Positive,1
the first headset on the marketplace it,0.25,Positive,1
is the first for apple and the beginning,0.25,Positive,1
of what they call what they're,0.0,Neutral,0
considering this era of spatial,0.0,Neutral,0
computing computing in a 3d environment,0.0,Neutral,0
in your physical space while wearing,0.0,Neutral,0
something on your head so in that sense,0.0,Neutral,0
this is still very early and so the,0.13,Positive,1
point and purpose of this video may be,0.0,Neutral,0
to help share my evaluation to help you,0.0,Neutral,0
make a purchasing decision but honestly,0.6,Positive,1
as a,0.0,Neutral,0
3500 headset to start before the,0.0,Neutral,0
upgrades and the accessories most of you,0.5,Positive,1
i think out there may have made up your,0.0,Neutral,0
"mind already 3,500 is a lot of money",0.0,Neutral,0
and so as anything this is more for,0.5,Positive,1
posterity this video is about a moment,0.0,Neutral,0
in time one month after this headset has,0.0,Neutral,0
first come out so that we can look at,0.25,Positive,1
this share our thoughts and 6 months,0.0,Neutral,0
later a year later 5 years 10 years,0.0,Neutral,0
later come back to this video and see,0.0,Neutral,0
what we got right and whether the ideas,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
that are presented here with the release,0.0,Neutral,0
of this headset and that we're sharing,0.0,Neutral,0
actually hold up that's the fun part,0.15,Positive,1
about making these videos and so the,0.0,Neutral,0
format of this is going to be a deep,0.0,Neutral,0
dive into the hardware a demonstration,0.0,Neutral,0
of the experiences and then a discussion,0.0,Neutral,0
and evaluation of the ins and outs of,0.0,Neutral,0
the experience of using apple vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
a little bit compared to for example the,-0.1875,Negative,0
meta quest 3 and and some thoughts going,0.0,Neutral,0
in some anecdotes about my time using it,0.0,Neutral,0
so strap on tight this is going to be a,-0.17857142857142858,Negative,0
long and deep dive it's not often that,-0.025,Negative,0
we get to review something that's the,0.0,Neutral,0
first of a new era of any type of,0.19318181818181818,Positive,1
computing and so i've been looking,0.0,Neutral,0
forward to this for a long time let's,-0.05,Negative,0
dive,0.0,Neutral,0
in so as is customary with these type of,0.0,Neutral,0
reviews i'm going to start off by,0.0,Neutral,0
talking about the the visual experience,0.0,Neutral,0
the displays and the optic because while,0.0,Neutral,0
apple doesn't position this as a virtual,0.0,Neutral,0
reality headset they call this a spatial,0.0,Neutral,0
computing device it fundamentally shares,0.0,Neutral,0
so much of the characteristics as vr,0.2,Positive,1
headsets and mr headsets that we've ed,0.0,Neutral,0
whether standalone ones or pc vr,0.0,Neutral,0
headsets they are wearable devices that,0.0,Neutral,0
take compute whether it's done on board,0.0,Neutral,0
or tethered or streamed uh and processes,0.0,Neutral,0
outside information through a series of,0.0,Neutral,0
sensors and cameras and then presents,0.0,Neutral,0
them them to you with displays and,0.0,Neutral,0
lenses and what apple's done here is,0.0,Neutral,0
they've chosen and they were able to,0.5,Positive,1
manufacture and produce at quantity the,0.0,Neutral,0
best display system i've seen in any,1.0,Positive,1
headset i've ever worn whether in the,0.0,Neutral,0
consumer space or even the professional,0.1,Positive,1
space and that all starts with these,0.0,Neutral,0
micro oled panels they've chosen these,0.0,Neutral,0
panels that uh with ifixit recent tear,0.0,Neutral,0
down we've now known to be 1.1 in small,-0.20277777777777778,Negative,0
micro oled panels that have a resolution,0.0,Neutral,0
roughly 3600 by 3200 so we can call in,-0.1,Negative,0
the realm of 4k 4k tvs aren't actually,0.0,Neutral,0
4k pixels wide now as you may know uh,-0.1,Negative,0
the resolution of these panels doesn't,0.0,Neutral,0
really mean a lot unless you're talking,-0.3125,Negative,0
about how that pairs with the field of,0.0,Neutral,0
view and so when we're talking about,0.0,Neutral,0
displays and headsets we're really,0.2,Positive,1
looking at a pixels per degree kind of,0.6,Positive,1
the equivalent as the pixels per inch,0.0,Neutral,0
metric that when we're looking at,0.0,Neutral,0
smartphones or laptop screens and on the,0.0,Neutral,0
highest end previous to the apple vision,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
pro you know the meta quest 3 had a,0.0,Neutral,0
respectable and pretty good pixels per,0.48333333333333334,Positive,1
degree of 25 the human eye can resolve,0.0,Neutral,0
up to 60 pixels per degree and we've,0.0,Neutral,0
seen headsets like big screen beyond and,0.0,Neutral,0
the vario arrow that crept up into the,0.0,Neutral,0
30s um with the apple vision pro with,0.0,Neutral,0
that 3600 pixel wide display at a,-0.1,Negative,0
reasonable field of view which does,0.2,Positive,1
change depending on how far your eyes,0.1,Positive,1
are from the lenses it's close to 34 35,0.0,Neutral,0
pixels per degree and that is,0.0,Neutral,0
immediately noticeable you know even as,0.0,Neutral,0
high resolution as the met quest 3 is,0.16,Positive,1
you're still noticing not necessarily,0.0,Neutral,0
the screen door effect know distance,0.0,Neutral,0
between the pixels but you're noticing,0.0,Neutral,0
aliasing and the size of text really can,0.2,Positive,1
change the readability of it here while,0.0,Neutral,0
i think even after weeks of use i would,0.0,Neutral,0
say i can still notice some aliasing in,0.0,Neutral,0
the edges of windows and even in three,0.0,Neutral,0
models and some of that text as well the,0.0,Neutral,0
pixels are nearly imperceptible i mean,-0.25625,Negative,0
every time i put this headset on i and,0.0,Neutral,0
pull up the home view menu of icons i am,0.0,Neutral,0
almost taken aback by how crisp and how,0.25,Positive,1
clear this display is and the fact they,0.10000000000000002,Positive,1
were able to manufacture those source,0.5,Positive,1
those and put them and then power them,0.0,Neutral,0
and run them on their m2 processor here,0.0,Neutral,0
is what makes this a class above just,0.0,Neutral,0
from a visual experience and where class,0.0,Neutral,0
above the headsets currently on the,0.0,Neutral,0
market today whether it is the big,0.0,Neutral,0
screen beyond vir arrow or the,0.0,Neutral,0
higher-end headsets tex even in its,0.0,Neutral,0
smallest size is incredibly readable,0.9,Positive,1
images photos and videos high resolution,0.16,Positive,1
photos and videos are crisp and look so,0.25,Positive,1
good in headset and 3d models are an,0.7,Positive,1
absolute joy to turn around and examine,0.5,Positive,1
up close as close as the headset will,0.0,Neutral,0
allow rendered at 100% native resolution,0.0,Neutral,0
even with some super sampling sometimes,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
added on to smooth out any of that,0.4,Positive,1
aliasing now unfortunately unlike with,-0.5,Negative,0
other headsets i'm not able to capture,-0.1875,Negative,0
photos through the lens because of the,0.0,Neutral,0
eye tracking system here once you take,0.0,Neutral,0
the headset off there's no way even with,0.0,Neutral,0
uh there's no proximity sensor that we,0.0,Neutral,0
can fool to have it display a persistent,0.0,Neutral,0
image for us to shoot video or photos,0.0,Neutral,0
through so it's one of those things,0.0,Neutral,0
that's really hard to communicate,-0.2916666666666667,Negative,0
because even with the screen capture,0.0,Neutral,0
that we're showing it doesn't really,0.2,Positive,1
show exactly how crisp these images look,0.25,Positive,1
how crisp the visuals are in headset and,0.25,Positive,1
as crisp and clear as that imagery is,0.17500000000000002,Positive,1
i'm primarily talking about the rendered,0.4,Positive,1
imagery the stuff generated by vision os,0.0,Neutral,0
whether it's applications text safari,0.0,Neutral,0
windows web browsing video things that,0.0,Neutral,0
are not part of the real world but the,0.2,Positive,1
real world is what you actually see when,0.1,Positive,1
you put this headset on because this is,0.0,Neutral,0
primarily a mixed reality headset it's,0.0,Neutral,0
not a virtual reality headset fully,0.0,Neutral,0
immersive fully enclosed vr experiences,0.0,Neutral,0
that put you somewhere else are here and,0.0,Neutral,0
they're almost like wallpapers to the,0.0,Neutral,0
content but apple wants this primarily,0.30000000000000004,Positive,1
to be a headset where you are,0.0,Neutral,0
experiencing in near real time the world,0.15000000000000002,Positive,1
around you with then computed rendered,0.0,Neutral,0
objects overlaid on top of that and the,0.5,Positive,1
pass through on this is the best i've,1.0,Positive,1
seen in a consumer headset it's higher,0.25,Positive,1
resolution it's better dynamic range and,0.25,Positive,1
it's more responsive than the pass,0.5,Positive,1
through in the meta quest 3 right now,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
it's a two 6.5 megapixel color cameras,0.0,Neutral,0
stereo cameras that then combined uh,0.0,Neutral,0
with the other sensors whether it's the,-0.125,Negative,0
true depth uh sensor or the lar sensor,0.35,Positive,1
or the other wide- angle cameras all,-0.1125,Negative,0
that is then fused and rectified to give,0.0,Neutral,0
you a near realtime responsive view of,0.1,Positive,1
your real world but it's also very,0.2,Positive,1
clearly video of that world the,0.10000000000000002,Positive,1
resolution isn't as crisp as what the,0.25,Positive,1
display panels can resolve and while the,0.0,Neutral,0
exposure and the image processing that,0.0,Neutral,0
they've done is i think a cut above the,0.0,Neutral,0
pass through systems of other headsets,-0.125,Negative,0
dynamic range looks good you can look,0.35,Positive,1
outside through a window and it will,0.0,Neutral,0
adjust exposure will adjust and you can,0.0,Neutral,0
look inside and you can interact with,0.0,Neutral,0
things like your phone you can write on,0.0,Neutral,0
a piece of paper you even watch a tv,0.0,Neutral,0
that's in the same room that you are and,0.0,Neutral,0
you can certainly talk to other people,0.04464285714285714,Positive,1
there's no mistaking the fact that these,0.0,Neutral,0
this is process video and you're going,0.0,Neutral,0
to maybe want more out of that pass,0.5,Positive,1
through if you're wearing this headset,0.0,Neutral,0
to actually interact with the things in,0.0,Neutral,0
the real space but aside from the,0.2,Positive,1
quality the visual quality of that pass,0.0,Neutral,0
through there are actually two other,-0.0625,Negative,0
attributes worth discussing and one is,0.3,Positive,1
that this pass through has no distortion,0.0,Neutral,0
so the way the past two cameras work is,-0.25,Negative,0
that it primarily relies on these two,0.4,Positive,1
cameras these two stereo cameras on the,0.0,Neutral,0
front of the headset or near the front,0.1,Positive,1
of this glass here and as with every,0.0,Neutral,0
headset like the quest 3 there are two,0.0,Neutral,0
cameras there as well those cameras,0.0,Neutral,0
ideally would be as close to where your,0.9,Positive,1
eyes are as possible to give you this,0.0,Neutral,0
perspective correct real time pass,0.2,Positive,1
through imagery and there's just no way,0.0,Neutral,0
for these cameras to be where your eyes,0.0,Neutral,0
are because your eyes are where your,0.0,Neutral,0
eyeballs are and so the software has to,0.0,Neutral,0
do some type of correction it has to,0.0,Neutral,0
analyze the scene combine it with depth,0.0,Neutral,0
data combine it with scans of the room,0.0,Neutral,0
and make an estimation as to where your,0.0,Neutral,0
eyes are and then kind of readjust,0.6,Positive,1
rectify reproject that image uh to be,0.0,Neutral,0
back where your eyes would be it's not,0.0,Neutral,0
an easy problem to solve in the quest 3,0.43333333333333335,Positive,1
this display system has geometric,0.0,Neutral,0
distortion while it is perfectly uh,1.0,Positive,1
perspective correct and you get a real,0.2,Positive,1
sense that an object that's a couple,0.0,Neutral,0
feet away is a couple feet away you can,0.0,Neutral,0
grab it no problem your hands are where,0.0,Neutral,0
your hands they should be you do see,0.0,Neutral,0
near field distortion in the meta quest,0.1,Positive,1
implementation of pass through video,0.0,Neutral,0
apple's pass through video has no,0.0,Neutral,0
nearfield distortion whatever they're,0.0,Neutral,0
doing to correct your hands and things,0.0,Neutral,0
in the near field it seems it's a,0.1,Positive,1
perfect stereo image at the cost though,1.0,Positive,1
of perspective correction uh in the far,0.1,Positive,1
field and where i think that's where,0.0,Neutral,0
some of the trade-offs come in if you,0.0,Neutral,0
look at something further than 5 m out,0.0,Neutral,0
you know a door frame or a window frame,0.0,Neutral,0
in the distance and you move your head,0.0,Neutral,0
quickly left and right you're going to,0.14285714285714285,Positive,1
see the lines of that door frame,0.0,Neutral,0
struggle to keep up and blur a little,-0.1875,Negative,0
bit and some people have called this the,0.0,Neutral,0
uh or they've identified this as uh,0.0,Neutral,0
persistence in the micro oled panels and,0.0,Neutral,0
i don't think it's actually pixel,0.0,Neutral,0
persistence in the micro oled panels,0.0,Neutral,0
although that may contribute to some of,0.0,Neutral,0
it if you move your hand really quickly,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
in front of your face in the near field,0.1,Positive,1
you don't notice that similar,0.0,Neutral,0
persistence you actually see it almost,0.0,Neutral,0
almost like a high shutter um movement,0.16,Positive,1
of your hand not a lot of motion blur,0.0,Neutral,0
it's only when you move your head side,0.0,Neutral,0
to side uh in the distance do you see,0.0,Neutral,0
some that blurring and some of that,0.0,Neutral,0
persistence so i think it's more a,0.5,Positive,1
characteristic of how they're rectifying,-0.06666666666666667,Negative,0
and reprojecting the imagery of the,0.0,Neutral,0
world uh so that they can make this,0.0,Neutral,0
decision to avoid nearfield distortion,0.0,Neutral,0
at the expense of correct perspectives,0.0,Neutral,0
in the distance uh maybe that lagging,0.0,Neutral,0
behind a bit i think that trade-off is,-0.4,Negative,0
actually worth it because in the headset,0.3,Positive,1
everything in the nearfield the things,0.0,Neutral,0
i'm interacting with most being correct,0.5,Positive,1
being stereo correct and also being uh,0.0,Neutral,0
undistorted unwarped just makes that,0.0,Neutral,0
whole pastor experience that much more,0.35,Positive,1
comfortable it does seem a class above,0.2,Positive,1
what i've seen in previous headsets uh,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
in terms of what decision they've made,0.0,Neutral,0
and it's especially important with the,0.8,Positive,1
second point is that your hands and your,0.0,Neutral,0
arms and even up to your shoulders have,0.0,Neutral,0
occlusion in the pass through systems,0.0,Neutral,0
what's being run through the apple r1,0.0,Neutral,0
chip in the vision pro they've,0.0,Neutral,0
prioritized the ability to recognize the,0.0,Neutral,0
visual representation of your hand your,0.0,Neutral,0
arm and up to your shoulder and do a,0.0,Neutral,0
real-time rotoscoping this kind of,0.6,Positive,1
cutout of the shape of your hand to,0.0,Neutral,0
overlay on top of any digital imagery,0.25,Positive,1
applications anything that's rendered,0.0,Neutral,0
it's something that in past pass through,-0.25,Negative,0
systems has always created this this,0.0,Neutral,0
discomfort or this misalignment because,0.0,Neutral,0
if you put your hand in front of a,0.0,Neutral,0
virtual object the virtual object even,0.0,Neutral,0
though it maybe converge many feet away,0.5,Positive,1
it's still going to overlay on top of,0.5,Positive,1
your the the representation of your hand,0.0,Neutral,0
and that's why on the quest they use,0.0,Neutral,0
these outlines of your hand to allow for,0.0,Neutral,0
recognition of occlusion in the vision,0.0,Neutral,0
pro it's just video this realtime,0.0,Neutral,0
rotoscoping of your hand that is,0.0,Neutral,0
overlaid and they do it really really,0.2,Positive,1
well now there are some quirks with this,0.0,Neutral,0
um because that rotoscoping well near,0.1,Positive,1
perfect in a great lighting condition,0.9,Positive,1
when the lighting gets poor it loses,-0.35,Negative,0
that ability to generate that occlusion,0.0,Neutral,0
and while it recognizes things like you,0.0,Neutral,0
know you might be wearing an apple watch,0.0,Neutral,0
and you can look at the time if you're,0.0,Neutral,0
holding a smartphone up even an iphone,0.0,Neutral,0
it won't actually recognize that as part,0.0,Neutral,0
of the occlusion like they're modeling,0.0,Neutral,0
their training data doesn't recognize,0.0,Neutral,0
the standardized shape it's rectangle of,0.0,Neutral,0
a phone that you might be holding,0.0,Neutral,0
holding and so there was a weird cutout,-0.5,Negative,0
of this invisible phone that you you're,0.0,Neutral,0
just seeing through it's kind of odd,0.21666666666666667,Positive,1
that they didn't rec they didn't build,0.0,Neutral,0
in that recognition of a phone that you,0.0,Neutral,0
may be interacting with because they,0.0,Neutral,0
kind of want people to be maybe looking,0.6,Positive,1
at their phones checking messages as,0.0,Neutral,0
well as they're using vision pro one of,0.0,Neutral,0
the funny ways i was able to test this,0.375,Positive,1
is hold my phone up and put my fingers,0.0,Neutral,0
behind it and my fingers would be masked,-0.4,Negative,0
cuz it couldn't recognize my fingers,0.0,Neutral,0
were there but i poke my fingers out you,0.0,Neutral,0
can actually see that rotoscoping is,0.0,Neutral,0
married with the skeletal modeling of my,0.25,Positive,1
hand and the prediction of my hand pose,0.0,Neutral,0
and so it would then realize my fingers,0.0,Neutral,0
were about to point poke up from behind,-0.4,Negative,0
the phone and then generate that,0.0,Neutral,0
rotoscoping above those fingers as well,0.0,Neutral,0
and it's not perfect you're able to,0.0,Neutral,0
trick it with uh you know where you move,0.0,Neutral,0
your fingers around these other occluded,-0.125,Negative,0
objects but it's interesting that,0.5,Positive,1
they're combining the visual rotoscoping,0.0,Neutral,0
with also the hand modeling to let you,0.0,Neutral,0
know let the system know where to do,0.0,Neutral,0
this cutout something that's also neat,0.0,Neutral,0
is that this cutout representation of,0.0,Neutral,0
your hand this video of your hand is,0.0,Neutral,0
also affected dynamically with some of,0.0,Neutral,0
the lighting uh changes that uh the,0.0,Neutral,0
system may employ so if you uh put on a,0.0,Neutral,0
fully immersive environment like a,0.0,Neutral,0
cinema or for example one of their uh,0.0,Neutral,0
preset environments like y at night time,0.0,Neutral,0
the system has a light model for what,0.4,Positive,1
that environment is supposed to be like,0.0,Neutral,0
at night time and then will actually,0.0,Neutral,0
darken and create shadows over that,0.0,Neutral,0
video of your hand so it's not the,0.0,Neutral,0
lighting of your real environment that's,0.2,Positive,1
affecting your hand they're masking over,0.0,Neutral,0
it kind of an augmented reality way of,0.6,Positive,1
masking lighting uh to better match this,0.5,Positive,1
immersive environment really neat way,0.2,Positive,1
that they're making your hand presence,0.0,Neutral,0
feel as natural as possible in addition,0.05,Positive,1
to how responsive how low latency that,0.0,Neutral,0
hand movement is that's the pass through,0.0,Neutral,0
and then finally that hand tracking is,0.0,Neutral,0
so important to the way you primarily,0.4,Positive,1
interface with the vision pro which is,0.0,Neutral,0
through a combination of ey tracking,0.0,Neutral,0
which is used for targeting and,0.0,Neutral,0
interacting with the environment as well,0.0,Neutral,0
as fiated rendering and also the hand,0.0,Neutral,0
tracked model of your hand a re,0.0,Neutral,0
recognizing a simple tap gesture there's,0.0,Neutral,0
only one gesture one type of click,0.0,Neutral,0
equivalent you can do in vision pro and,0.0,Neutral,0
that's by just tapping your fingers,0.0,Neutral,0
together and to best demonstrate that,1.0,Positive,1
let's head to the studio and see what,0.0,Neutral,0
using apple vision pro is actually like,0.0,Neutral,0
so here we are in the tested studio and,0.0,Neutral,0
what you're seeing is a capture of the,0.0,Neutral,0
pass through video it's actually uh,0.0,Neutral,0
capturing both my eyes so unlike some,0.0,Neutral,0
other vr headsets it's not a left eye or,-0.0625,Negative,0
right eye capture although what i see is,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
actually a slightly wider field of view,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
than what you see this is essentially a,0.0,Neutral,0
1080p capture and hopefully you'll be,0.0,Neutral,0
able to see uh some of the details i'm,0.5,Positive,1
talking about but i want to really run,0.2,Positive,1
through what using vision os is like now,0.0,Neutral,0
on the top right of the headset there's,0.39285714285714285,Positive,1
the digital crown i press that or i can,0.0,Neutral,0
activate a home view is what they call,0.0,Neutral,0
this it's essentially the home screen,0.0,Neutral,0
but floating in space and already this,0.0,Neutral,0
with the subtle animations of the icon,-0.3333333333333333,Negative,0
these are like three layers of imagery,0.0,Neutral,0
per icon when i gaze at an icon and tap,0.0,Neutral,0
and move my hands the subtle animations,-0.3333333333333333,Negative,0
the level of polish just that smoothness,0.0,Neutral,0
of even moving the home view icons is,0.0,Neutral,0
indicative of what a polished experience,0.0,Neutral,0
this all is and i wanted to first,0.25,Positive,1
demonstrate some a basic application so,0.0,Neutral,0
photos right in the center of the screen,0.09285714285714285,Positive,1
probably the most compelling uh native,0.4,Positive,1
application here and it's essentially a,0.0,Neutral,0
flat window pane so it opens up where i,-0.025,Negative,0
clicked it and to interact with it i am,0.0,Neutral,0
just holding either of my hands out and,0.0,Neutral,0
tapping and dragging as if it was uh i,0.0,Neutral,0
was holding on to a string or something,0.0,Neutral,0
and it's very responsive and the field,0.2,Positive,1
of view of what it captures from my,0.0,Neutral,0
hands is actually pretty impressive so,0.625,Positive,1
i'm going to hold on to this window and,0.0,Neutral,0
keep on manipulating it but also move my,0.0,Neutral,0
hand and i can't actually see my hand,0.0,Neutral,0
right now it's outside my visual field,0.09523809523809523,Positive,1
of view but it's still well within the,0.0,Neutral,0
field of view of the downward facing and,0.0,Neutral,0
outward facing tracking cameras if i,0.0,Neutral,0
move my hand above it's still i can't,0.0,Neutral,0
see my hand really and has that tracking,0.2,Positive,1
but like over my head of course there's,0.0,Neutral,0
no tracking there behind my head no,-0.4,Negative,0
tracking as well so really is made for,0.2,Positive,1
your hands to be kind of in a natural,0.35,Positive,1
resting position you know you see a lot,0.0,Neutral,0
of people demos holding their hands out,0.0,Neutral,0
to interact you don't need to do that,0.0,Neutral,0
it's more about keeping it in a,0.5,Positive,1
comfortable position not fatiguing your,0.4,Positive,1
arm your wrist just having it kind of,0.6,Positive,1
rested whether you're standing up or,0.0,Neutral,0
you're sitting down and then you can,-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
manipulate these windows so photos,0.0,Neutral,0
safari i have instances of safari popped,0.0,Neutral,0
up here and these are all running,0.0,Neutral,0
they're not like ios or ipad os,0.0,Neutral,0
applications where uh they're only,0.0,Neutral,0
running one at a time these are more,0.5,Positive,1
like desktop versions where they're,0.0,Neutral,0
running all the scripts and all the,0.0,Neutral,0
animations on these windows at once and,0.0,Neutral,0
i can reposition them so i can see i can,0.0,Neutral,0
push them further away or closer to me,0.0,Neutral,0
move within that z-axis and same with,0.0,Neutral,0
the safar windows i can you know move,0.0,Neutral,0
them up and down or push them far or,-0.02777777777777779,Negative,0
near or far away something should notice,0.1,Positive,1
that's really interesting is the text in,0.5,Positive,1
the safari windows and happens with your,0.0,Neutral,0
mail application and anything with text,0.0,Neutral,0
it's actually staying the same size as i,0.0,Neutral,0
move that window closer and further away,0.0,Neutral,0
it's keeping the relative size of the,0.0,Neutral,0
text even though the window itself is,0.0,Neutral,0
expanding it's almost kind of like a a,0.6,Positive,1
dolly zoom for the image on here so you,0.0,Neutral,0
it's trying to make it as readable as,0.0,Neutral,0
possible and keeping it even though you,0.0,Neutral,0
can change the the size of your text,0.0,Neutral,0
here you can scale up the text up or,0.0,Neutral,0
down but it wants to be it wants to be,0.08148148148148147,Positive,1
as readable as possible and one of the,0.0,Neutral,0
tricks they're doing even as i expand,0.0,Neutral,0
the windows here to make it bigger and i,0.0,Neutral,0
move the windows closer it's keeping,0.0,Neutral,0
that text exactly the same size,0.125,Positive,1
something that's also interesting is how,0.5,Positive,1
it's keeping track of the space around,0.0,Neutral,0
you the slam tracking simultaneous,0.0,Neutral,0
location and mapping and there's lar,0.0,Neutral,0
sensor there's a true depth sensor there,0.35,Positive,1
are stereo cameras and the window panes,0.0,Neutral,0
here whether it's flat windows or,-0.025,Negative,0
volumes are really locked in place now i,0.2,Positive,1
can move them i can move them kind of,0.6,Positive,1
within this sphere around me but i can,0.0,Neutral,0
also move out of that sphere of movement,0.0,Neutral,0
and it kind of stays with me and for,0.6,Positive,1
example there's a table right here i can,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
move this,0.0,Neutral,0
window through the table and,0.0,Neutral,0
acknowledges that there is some type of,0.0,Neutral,0
surface you saw the safari window go a,0.0,Neutral,0
little bit transparent as it realizes,-0.1875,Negative,0
it's going behind an object but if i let,-0.4,Negative,0
it go it actually then goes fully,0.0,Neutral,0
visible there's a little bit of a,-0.1875,Negative,0
conversion misalignment because my braid,0.0,Neutral,0
wants the table to be in front of the s,0.2,Positive,1
fire window but they're prioritizing the,0.0,Neutral,0
reading of your digital content over the,0.0,Neutral,0
physical space you can't though actually,0.0,Neutral,0
have your flat window panes like lock,-0.025,Negative,0
into flat surfaces or walls you can kind,0.2875,Positive,1
of push them through walls again it's,0.0,Neutral,0
acknowledging there's a wall there by,0.0,Neutral,0
going a little more transparent but you,0.15625,Positive,1
can't actually have them stick to the,0.0,Neutral,0
wall and there's a lack of stickiness in,0.0,Neutral,0
terms of window management the windows,0.0,Neutral,0
themselves these interactive panes are,0.0,Neutral,0
locked in place but if i hold down the,-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
digital crown it'll reset everything and,0.0,Neutral,0
there's no way to say save this,0.0,Neutral,0
arrangement of my workspace for my home,0.0,Neutral,0
save this arrangement for the studio uh,0.0,Neutral,0
you just have to kind of reset it up,0.6,Positive,1
every single time the other type of,-0.09821428571428571,Negative,0
native vision application are volumes,0.0,Neutral,0
and here's a good example of it this is,0.7,Positive,1
lego builders and unlike a safari window,0.0,Neutral,0
or the photos app it's actually a,0.0,Neutral,0
three-dimensional volume you can think,0.0,Neutral,0
of it almost not not exact like a sphere,-0.125,Negative,0
but you can see the edges of it uh and,0.0,Neutral,0
the digital content is within it i can,0.0,Neutral,0
peer within it but if i move my head,0.0,Neutral,0
inside to really get a nearfield,0.2,Positive,1
interaction with the digital content,0.0,Neutral,0
kind of vignettes out the world around,0.6,Positive,1
me and it's really neat that there are,0.2,Positive,1
applications where these these,0.0,Neutral,0
volumetric applications can live,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
alongside the floating pains as well,0.0,Neutral,0
there're also a third type of,0.0,Neutral,0
application and of course that's the,0.0,Neutral,0
compatible apps they're listed right,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
here in the home view and these are then,0.0,Neutral,0
ipad or iphone applications that where,0.0,Neutral,0
the developers have not chosen to opt,0.0,Neutral,0
out and so you can bring in you know,0.0,Neutral,0
lightroom from adobe and here it's kind,0.6,Positive,1
of like having a floating ipad screen,0.0,Neutral,0
you can change the orientation to,0.0,Neutral,0
portrait or landscape orient ation you,0.0,Neutral,0
can interact with it with your gaze and,0.0,Neutral,0
tap gesture but one thing i like to do,0.0,Neutral,0
is actually bring it real close and,0.1,Positive,1
almost have like a you know 12-in ipad,0.0,Neutral,0
in front of me and use it a direct touch,0.1,Positive,1
method so poke my finger through the,0.0,Neutral,0
screen and interact with it i'm not,0.0,Neutral,0
getting any haptic feedback here but,0.0,Neutral,0
it's really usable where i can just grab,0.2,Positive,1
the pan and move it around uh something,0.0,Neutral,0
i wish i could do is tilt it i wish,0.0,Neutral,0
there were handles on the side where i,0.0,Neutral,0
can you know more manipulate it and kind,0.55,Positive,1
of again place it more in different uh,0.25,Positive,1
spaces um but for ip applications for,0.0,Neutral,0
which there are over a million of them,0.0,Neutral,0
compatible in uh in vision pro um,0.0,Neutral,0
there's so much you can do it's having,0.2,Positive,1
as many ipads as you want uh now not,0.5,Positive,1
only are the visuals spatial here uh but,0.0,Neutral,0
the audio is as well and something,0.0,Neutral,0
that's interesting and maybe a little,0.15625,Positive,1
peculiar is uh if you open up you know,0.0,Neutral,0
for example apple music and you play a,0.0,Neutral,0
song the song will sound like it's,0.4,Positive,1
coming uh like as if you're wearing,0.0,Neutral,0
headphones will come from these little,-0.1875,Negative,0
speakers that are on the arms of the,0.0,Neutral,0
headset that's how i imagine you know,0.0,Neutral,0
listening to to songs off of your your,0.0,Neutral,0
phone would be and you can of course put,0.0,Neutral,0
on airpod pros or airpod max and listen,0.0,Neutral,0
or or connected to any bluetooth headset,0.0,Neutral,0
um and listen to music that way but if,0.0,Neutral,0
you open open a application like a,0.0,Neutral,0
podcast player and here i have,0.0,Neutral,0
pocketcast it's just a compatible app,0.0,Neutral,0
and i play audio from this player the,0.0,Neutral,0
audio will come from this window pane,0.0,Neutral,0
wherever i put it if i open up you know,0.0,Neutral,0
a safari browser and play youtube the,0.0,Neutral,0
audio will come from that window pane,0.0,Neutral,0
and right now there's no way to change,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
it where the positional audio can be,0.0,Neutral,0
toggled to more of a headlocked audio to,0.5,Positive,1
make it feel like i'm wearing headphones,0.0,Neutral,0
i'd really think about this as if it's,0.2,Positive,1
like a radio or a physical jukebox i'm,0.0,Neutral,0
placing in the room and the audio is,0.0,Neutral,0
going to come from that uh the hand,0.0,Neutral,0
tracking like i mentioned has been,0.0,Neutral,0
pretty good and you can see here an,0.475,Positive,1
example of the occlusion so this is the,0.0,Neutral,0
you know rotoscoping of my fingers,0.0,Neutral,0
around uh both my hands uh that's,0.0,Neutral,0
actually i think i think separate from,0.0,Neutral,0
the actual hand tracking model this is,0.0,Neutral,0
just the visual rotoscoping and if you,0.0,Neutral,0
load up applications like the encounter,0.0,Neutral,0
dinosaurs app it opens up with a a,0.0,Neutral,0
butterfly flying and landing on your,0.0,Neutral,0
fingers and one way i've been able to,0.5,Positive,1
test just the latency of the hand,0.0,Neutral,0
tracking is to move my hand away from,0.0,Neutral,0
that butterfly and the butterfly,0.0,Neutral,0
struggles to keep up even though the,0.0,Neutral,0
visual representation of my rotoscope,0.0,Neutral,0
hand is moving near instantaneously the,0.1,Positive,1
late see here for the visual,-0.15,Negative,0
representation of your hand is quite,0.0,Neutral,0
good the hand tracking model lags behind,0.14999999999999997,Positive,1
that just a little bit one other thing i,-0.15625,Negative,0
want to point out that's going to be,0.0,Neutral,0
really hard to communicate because it's,-0.2916666666666667,Negative,0
an optical art optical artifact is i've,0.0,Neutral,0
noticed that because the headset is,0.0,Neutral,0
doing an active calibration and,-0.13333333333333333,Negative,0
correction for my uh lenses that i'm,0.0,Neutral,0
wearing the zeiss lenses as well as uh,0.0,Neutral,0
what uh where my eyes are looking there,0.0,Neutral,0
seems to be a slight mismatch,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
occasionally in uh text on top of white,0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
background like on this web page here,0.0,Neutral,0
where it looks like there's a almost a,0.0,Neutral,0
bumpy texture of text on top of the,0.5,Positive,1
white background and when i scroll up,0.0,Neutral,0
and down i almost notice it's like,-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
looking at a um a magic eye image,0.5,Positive,1
incorrectly i haven't seen a lot of,0.0,Neutral,0
people talk about this but something,0.0,Neutral,0
i've notice in the mail application and,0.0,Neutral,0
on uh white web pages with dark high,0.003333333333333336,Positive,1
contrast text so i think it's due to the,-0.125,Negative,0
active correction of uh the image for uh,-0.13333333333333333,Negative,0
the stereo representation um of the,0.0,Neutral,0
application and one more thing i wanted,0.5,Positive,1
to demonstrate was well uh you're seeing,0.0,Neutral,0
these applications in on top of the pass,0.5,Positive,1
through of the world apple also has a,0.0,Neutral,0
selection of what they call immersive,0.0,Neutral,0
environments some pre-loaded some coming,0.0,Neutral,0
soon where you can load up environments,0.0,Neutral,0
like yosity and here is yosity,0.0,Neutral,0
at night but if we turn today you,0.0,Neutral,0
actually have your applications in a,0.0,Neutral,0
kind of a photogrametry uh version of,0.6,Positive,1
your sem there's some geometry in the,0.0,Neutral,0
foreground as well as some animated um,0.0,Neutral,0
details in the background as well you,0.0,Neutral,0
can use a digital crown to make that,0.0,Neutral,0
fully immersive so it's a full 360,0.35,Positive,1
environment where you're getting parallx,0.0,Neutral,0
with like the trees for example um,0.0,Neutral,0
and this kind of lets you focus in on,0.6,Positive,1
just the content without being,0.0,Neutral,0
distracted by the outside world mak can,0.0,Neutral,0
always turn a digital crown to fade back,0.0,Neutral,0
into the real world so i hope that gave,0.2,Positive,1
you an idea of what this concept of,0.0,Neutral,0
spatial computing is like in the vision,0.0,Neutral,0
pro and here's where i want to talk,0.0,Neutral,0
about performance and polish and just,0.0,Neutral,0
the user interface experience in this,0.0,Neutral,0
because we've seen a lot of discussion,0.0,Neutral,0
about things that you can do already in,0.0,Neutral,0
a 500 headset uh like the quest 3 even,0.0,Neutral,0
natively web browsing or using,0.0,Neutral,0
thirdparty applications like virtual,0.0,Neutral,0
desktop or immersed and to some extent,0.0,Neutral,0
all of that is true one of my favorite,0.425,Positive,1
things i did when using the quest pro,0.0,Neutral,0
and the quest 3 was open up you know,0.0,Neutral,0
instances of the web browser and watch,0.0,Neutral,0
youtube and have you know have uh slack,0.0,Neutral,0
uh web interface on the right side but,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
that experience while it's possible and,0.0,Neutral,0
i acknowledge that uh is still limited,-0.07142857142857142,Negative,0
i've been harping on wanting progressive,0.0,Neutral,0
web apps to be more of a thing in in,0.5,Positive,1
meta quest and they really haven't,0.2,Positive,1
leaned into it the browser is a little,-0.1875,Negative,0
dated you're limited to these three,-0.07142857142857142,Negative,0
windows that while you can resize,0.0,Neutral,0
they're kind of fix in orient in,0.6,Positive,1
orientation to each other and it really,0.037500000000000006,Positive,1
feels like you know like if you on a,0.0,Neutral,0
game console using the web browser on a,-0.4,Negative,0
game console rather than a actual,-0.2,Negative,0
computing device and on vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
there's the freedom to open as many of,0.25,Positive,1
these instances as you want and to,0.0,Neutral,0
position them anywhere you want and one,0.0,Neutral,0
of the things i've been most impressed,0.75,Positive,1
by is on hardware that's not even the,0.0,Neutral,0
latest processor that apple makes this,0.5,Positive,1
is the m2 chip and they've already have,0.0,Neutral,0
macbooks with the m3 out there and this,0.0,Neutral,0
is on 16 gigs of ram it feels like you,0.0,Neutral,0
can have as many ipad compatible windows,0.5,Positive,1
as you want and as many instances and,0.5,Positive,1
tabs of safari as you can place in your,0.0,Neutral,0
room and the system is far from bug-free,0.1,Positive,1
because there have been instances where,0.0,Neutral,0
i've had to hold down the digital crown,-0.07777777777777779,Negative,0
and the top button to open a force quit,0.25,Positive,1
window to quit applications it's you,0.0,Neutral,0
know kind of the equivalent of you,0.6,Positive,1
swiping up from your phone but the fact,0.0,Neutral,0
that they don't limit the amount of,0.0,Neutral,0
windows that you can have open these,0.0,Neutral,0
planes of interfaces that you can have,0.0,Neutral,0
open is a testament to how far ahead,0.05,Positive,1
this device works as a computing device,0.0,Neutral,0
over a gaming device that you can also,0.0,Neutral,0
do web browsing and you know word,0.0,Neutral,0
processing on um and one of the ways,0.0,Neutral,0
that they're able to do that because,0.5,Positive,1
these processes do run in real time is,0.2,Positive,1
uh limit um the refresh rate of those,0.0,Neutral,0
windows and the way i understand it is,0.0,Neutral,0
that you may have for example you know,0.0,Neutral,0
four safari windows uh tabs open and,0.0,Neutral,0
animations and scripts are running on,0.0,Neutral,0
all of those at once but the window that,0.0,Neutral,0
you're focused on that gets the full 90,0.35,Positive,1
frames per second update and windows,0.0,Neutral,0
that may be more faded in the background,0.5,Positive,1
or around you while those scripts are,0.0,Neutral,0
running under the entire safari process,0.0,Neutral,0
tree those aren't getting the visual,0.0,Neutral,0
refresh rate uh until you do focus on,0.0,Neutral,0
them so they're using little tricks here,-0.1875,Negative,0
and there to make multitasking work in,0.0,Neutral,0
real time but not strain the processor,0.2,Positive,1
and it's place where i'm looking forward,0.0,Neutral,0
to with the next version where they tap,0.0,Neutral,0
into the m3 or whatever next chip they,0.0,Neutral,0
put in here because i do want more and,0.5,Positive,1
more uh i notice that when i do have,0.5,Positive,1
half a dozen windows up and things like,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
google docs you know things that are a,0.0,Neutral,0
little more memory intensive um,0.15625,Positive,1
scrolling using things like apple music,0.0,Neutral,0
the smoothness of some of the animations,0.0,Neutral,0
does go away and so you do have to do a,0.0,Neutral,0
little bit of memory management on your,-0.1875,Negative,0
own um if you have a ton of stuff that,0.6,Positive,1
you're,0.0,Neutral,0
multitasking so another thing they're,0.0,Neutral,0
doing to optimize for performance,0.0,Neutral,0
especially in pushing all those pixels,0.0,Neutral,0
to these two high resolution displays is,0.16,Positive,1
fiated rendering the eye tracking has to,0.0,Neutral,0
be good enough not only for interaction,0.2333333333333333,Positive,1
with the windows uh but also for,0.0,Neutral,0
tracking where to display the highest,0.0,Neutral,0
density of the rendering and it's pretty,0.25,Positive,1
impressive now in the video we've been,1.0,Positive,1
sharing of the capture of the device you,0.0,Neutral,0
can actually see the foliated space it's,0.0,Neutral,0
kind of small the these small circles or,0.033333333333333326,Positive,1
almost like squares um and as i'm moving,0.0,Neutral,0
across like a large excel sheet that's a,0.21428571428571427,Positive,1
great demo you can see where the detail,0.8,Positive,1
trails off on the edges where you're not,0.0,Neutral,0
looking but also how responsive it is to,0.0,Neutral,0
where your ey tracking is um so it's,0.0,Neutral,0
testament to the fact that fate,0.0,Neutral,0
rendering can work and for me it's been,0.0,Neutral,0
not noticeable in headset i'm darting my,0.0,Neutral,0
eyes left and right and up and down as,0.04338624338624337,Positive,1
fast as possible even kind of focus,0.26666666666666666,Positive,1
forward but trying to see off onto the,0.0,Neutral,0
periphery i cannot notice the resolution,0.0,Neutral,0
falling off it's everything just looks,0.0,Neutral,0
sharp to me as uh as it's rendering at,-0.125,Negative,0
you know 100% resolution uh where my,0.0,Neutral,0
eyes are focused and as capable as the,0.2,Positive,1
system is with the data vision,0.0,Neutral,0
applications as well as the ipad,0.0,Neutral,0
compatible applications it really feels,0.2,Positive,1
like having a ton of ipads the ipad,0.0,Neutral,0
level of computing versus a desktop or,0.0,Neutral,0
laptop level of computing both in terms,0.0,Neutral,0
of how you interact with those,0.0,Neutral,0
applications plus how much visual,0.0,Neutral,0
density you can get with the ui of those,0.0,Neutral,0
applications uh some of the stuff is a,0.0,Neutral,0
little bit interesting for example the,0.15625,Positive,1
photos application which about being,0.0,Neutral,0
maybe the best visual representation of,0.5,Positive,1
the photos app my photos of my family my,0.0,Neutral,0
kids i've taken with the phone looks so,0.0,Neutral,0
good in headset that photos app clearly,0.39999999999999997,Positive,1
something they want to promote and want,0.0,Neutral,0
people to use as a killer app for this,0.0,Neutral,0
it is less capable than the photos app,0.016666666666666677,Positive,1
that you have on an iphone or an ipad,0.0,Neutral,0
you can crop an image if you pull a,0.0,Neutral,0
photo out and use a preview but you,0.0,Neutral,0
can't do any actual image editing like,0.0,Neutral,0
uh adjust your portrait photos adjust,0.0,Neutral,0
brightness contrast any of that tweaking,0.0,Neutral,0
that you can do in photos app here,0.0,Neutral,0
they're going to want you to maybe,0.0,Neutral,0
download a third party application to,0.0,Neutral,0
manipulate kind of interesting what they,0.55,Positive,1
were able to get into their first party,0.375,Positive,1
applications in time for this launch now,0.0,Neutral,0
apple also sees vision pro useful as,0.3,Positive,1
kind of a a portable apple studio,0.6,Positive,1
display it's an accessory for your mac,0.0,Neutral,0
computing device and when used with mac,0.0,Neutral,0
mini uh macbook air macbook pro you,0.0,Neutral,0
basically can mirror what's on that,0.0,Neutral,0
display what that single desktop in,-0.07142857142857142,Negative,0
headset at any size that you want to,0.0,Neutral,0
have it in front of you and that's kind,0.6,Positive,1
of been one of the dreams of having uh,0.0,Neutral,0
virtual reality headsets you know,0.0,Neutral,0
michael abash has talked about wanting,0.0,Neutral,0
infinite displays and infinite monitors,0.0,Neutral,0
and if you have mac os and you have the,0.0,Neutral,0
the full computing power of the,0.35,Positive,1
operating system with that processor,0.0,Neutral,0
having that run your compute your you,0.0,Neutral,0
know your video editing your photo,0.0,Neutral,0
editing but using the headset just to,0.0,Neutral,0
display a mirror of that that's a,0.0,Neutral,0
powerful combination especially with the,0.15,Positive,1
display resolution in this headset being,0.0,Neutral,0
such that you can actually see and use,0.0,Neutral,0
those virtual monitors almost as well as,0.0,Neutral,0
your laptop screen and certainly in a,0.21428571428571427,Positive,1
larger scale than your laptop screen but,0.0,Neutral,0
here it's also feels like a first,0.25,Positive,1
generation implementation because there,0.0,Neutral,0
are some limitations uh one it is a,0.0,Neutral,0
single screen mirroring right now so if,0.10714285714285714,Positive,1
you have your macbook you open it up,0.0,Neutral,0
there's actually a little augmented,-0.1875,Negative,0
reality connect dialogue uh button right,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
on top that floats above your your,0.25,Positive,1
macbook and so there's a bluetooth,0.0,Neutral,0
connection that recognizes the vision,0.0,Neutral,0
pro with your macbook device dev and you,0.0,Neutral,0
can tap that connect button and the,0.0,Neutral,0
screen goes dark on your laptop and then,-0.15,Negative,0
pops up in view that you can scale now,0.0,Neutral,0
the resolution of this virtual display,0.0,Neutral,0
is uh is complicated because the macbook,-0.5,Negative,0
renders its own desktop in a variety of,0.6,Positive,1
different resolutions and different ways,0.0,Neutral,0
um your macbook might have uh 2560 by,0.0,Neutral,0
1440 native resolution but in the back,0.0,Neutral,0
end it might be actually rendering,0.0,Neutral,0
double that four times as many pixels a,0.25,Positive,1
5k display and then pixel doubling for,0.0,Neutral,0
the retina implementation of that in,0.0,Neutral,0
vision os you can actually render the,0.0,Neutral,0
full 5k number pixels at dpi and so you,0.35,Positive,1
can have uh what's effectively a very,0.2,Positive,1
large virtual desktop with a ton of,0.21428571428571427,Positive,1
windows uh so that compensates for the,0.0,Neutral,0
fact that this is a single display but,-0.07142857142857142,Negative,0
you won't get the pixel doubling so,0.0,Neutral,0
won't have as much of the smooth,0.30000000000000004,Positive,1
anti-alias,0.0,Neutral,0
as in that retina,0.0,Neutral,0
2560x1440 mode you can kind of toggle,0.6,Positive,1
there seems to be a sweet spot if you're,0.35,Positive,1
rendering at near 4k um but also 4k,0.1,Positive,1
seems to be also the native video,0.0,Neutral,0
resolution of that direct connection,0.1,Positive,1
it's actually going over your wi-fi once,0.0,Neutral,0
you have that bluetooth handshake,0.0,Neutral,0
between headset and your compute device,0.0,Neutral,0
and you connect it then uses its own,0.6,Positive,1
wi-fi chips for direct connection not,0.1,Positive,1
using your home wi-fi to improve latency,0.0,Neutral,0
and that wi-fi video basically video,0.0,Neutral,0
encode and decode on the headset is,0.0,Neutral,0
limited to 4k and that's perhaps the,-0.07142857142857142,Negative,0
reason that right now they're only doing,0.14285714285714285,Positive,1
single monitor mirroring not double or,-0.03571428571428571,Negative,0
three monitor mirroring even though i,0.0,Neutral,0
know you know that the macbooks can,0.0,Neutral,0
handle doing multiple monitors at once,0.0,Neutral,0
there are also you know third part party,0.0,Neutral,0
applications uh like moonlight that will,0.0,Neutral,0
allow you to mirror from a windows pc a,0.0,Neutral,0
desktop pc and experiences are great as,0.8,Positive,1
well but the limiting factor for that,0.0,Neutral,0
for all of this for using any of these,0.0,Neutral,0
virtual desktop experiences uh is not,0.0,Neutral,0
the resolution or the clarity of the,0.0,Neutral,0
image which i find perfectly usable for,1.0,Positive,1
playing games for video editing and,0.0,Neutral,0
photo editing but the ergonomics of the,0.0,Neutral,0
apple vision pro and so now it's time to,0.0,Neutral,0
talk about comfort and maybe the most,0.5,Positive,1
controversial thing about apple vision,0.55,Positive,1
pro is the fact that even with this,0.0,Neutral,0
353 g battery separate and tethered from,0.0,Neutral,0
the headset it is still a relatively,0.0,Neutral,0
heavy headset at up to 650 gam somewhere,-0.2,Negative,0
between 600 and 650 gam depending on the,0.0,Neutral,0
light seal configuration and so it is,0.4,Positive,1
front glass there is a front display,0.0,Neutral,0
panel here uh for their eyesight feature,0.0,Neutral,0
which we'll talk about later um the full,0.175,Positive,1
fan and processor the display system the,0.0,Neutral,0
optic stack here for me even these nice,0.6,Positive,1
lenses that magnetically snap on uh and,0.0,Neutral,0
then all of that is uh interfaced with,0.0,Neutral,0
this light seal this custom fit light,0.4000000000000001,Positive,1
seal and now what they've done here i,0.0,Neutral,0
think is pretty remarkable because,0.5,Positive,1
they've not gone with a one siiz fit,0.4,Positive,1
most design which is what something like,0.5,Positive,1
the meta quest has done for now you can,0.0,Neutral,0
adjust on those headsets the eye relief,0.0,Neutral,0
um with different facial interfaces and,0.0,Neutral,0
they've there have been alternate fits,0.0,Neutral,0
and third-party versions of the facial,0.0,Neutral,0
interfaces for the quest headsets and,0.0,Neutral,0
the rift headsets and other third party,-0.0625,Negative,0
headsets and doesn't go as granular as,0.0,Neutral,0
what you know the big screen beyond does,0.0,Neutral,0
which is a face scanned um perfectly,1.0,Positive,1
custom machine and manufactured facial,0.0,Neutral,0
interface that perfectly conforms to the,1.0,Positive,1
shape uh of every user here you're doing,0.0,Neutral,0
a face scan and they then take that,0.0,Neutral,0
geometry of that face scan and,0.0,Neutral,0
categorize you into one of 28 different,0.0,Neutral,0
shapes and sizes it's actually 14,0.0,Neutral,0
different shapes with two variants a,0.0,Neutral,0
narrow and a wide and so i've used a 23,-0.15000000000000002,Negative,0
w here and the difference between a 21 w,0.0,Neutral,0
23 w 25w or 33w or 14 w is very opaque,0.2,Positive,1
it's not been very clear people apple,0.13000000000000003,Positive,1
users have compared notes you can go,0.0,Neutral,0
into an apple store and ask them to,0.0,Neutral,0
bring out different fits for you to try,0.0,Neutral,0
which i did and to the best that we can,1.0,Positive,1
understand the numbers are more,0.5,Positive,1
corresponded primarily to the shape of,0.4,Positive,1
this interface rather than the width or,0.0,Neutral,0
the depth of the size there is there are,0.0,Neutral,0
a few variants for the actual shapes so,-0.1,Negative,0
people with more prouder brows maybe,0.5,Positive,1
with higher cheekbones and you want as,0.25,Positive,1
much of this light seal and the light,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
seal gasket here light seal pad to be,0.4,Positive,1
touching your face as possible um for me,0.25,Positive,1
i like the weight more on my forehead,0.5,Positive,1
than on my cheeks and so there's also,0.0,Neutral,0
preferences between for people depending,0.0,Neutral,0
on where they like the weight of a,0.0,Neutral,0
wearable like this but primarily you,0.4,Positive,1
want to block out as much light as,0.4,Positive,1
possible comfortable to wear as long as,0.11666666666666668,Positive,1
you as long periods of time as you can,-0.05,Negative,0
um and then there is a variation for,0.0,Neutral,0
width so you're narrow and your wide,-0.15000000000000002,Negative,0
variance as well as depth depending on,0.0,Neutral,0
whether you're using the magnetic,0.0,Neutral,0
inserts or not which just very simply,0.0,Neutral,0
pop in people have tried using the,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro without the light seal you,0.4,Positive,1
know clipping it to a baseball the brim,0.0,Neutral,0
of a baseball cap to expand the field of,0.0,Neutral,0
view uh and while ey tracking still,0.0,Neutral,0
works and you can get some you know,0.0,Neutral,0
peripheral light um coming in uh i found,0.4,Positive,1
it not very comfortable in fact you get,-0.15384615384615385,Negative,0
a warning that says caution your headset,0.0,Neutral,0
the lenses are too close to your eyes uh,0.0,Neutral,0
and i've gone back to using the light,0.2,Positive,1
seal this 23 uh w uh having tried things,0.0,Neutral,0
like the 21 w and a 25 w but you can't,0.0,Neutral,0
get around the fact that the vast,0.0,Neutral,0
majority of the weight on this is in the,0.0,Neutral,0
front here and the strap that they,0.0,Neutral,0
include there are two straps the primary,0.4,Positive,1
one is this knit strap has has not a ton,0.0,Neutral,0
of structure in it uh kind of like the,0.6,Positive,1
the rigid headstraps that you might get,0.0,Neutral,0
um with uh the the quest and the elite,0.0,Neutral,0
headstrap or the the halo style bands,0.0,Neutral,0
that you get uh for third party uh strap,0.0,Neutral,0
makers or what was in the the,0.0,Neutral,0
playstation vr and the quest pro now,0.0,Neutral,0
their design decision here seems to be,0.0,Neutral,0
maximizing the surface area with this,0.0,Neutral,0
wide tall back of the solo knit band uh,-0.05,Negative,0
which is designed impeccably i mean just,-0.3125,Negative,0
the the the fabric design of this,0.0,Neutral,0
elastic the way the single dial allows,-0.07142857142857142,Negative,0
you to loosen it up it's a wonderful,1.0,Positive,1
piece of industrial design the way it,0.0,Neutral,0
snaps on is actually can go either way,0.0,Neutral,0
so you can give the knob on either left,0.0,Neutral,0
or right side they also prioritize this,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
being soft so that when you lean back,0.05,Positive,1
when you're on a couch when you're using,0.0,Neutral,0
this on a pillow you don't have any hard,-0.2916666666666667,Negative,0
materials on the back of your head that,0.0,Neutral,0
seems to be a very conscious decision of,0.13,Positive,1
theirs now that doesn't preclude them,0.0,Neutral,0
offering a top strap option and there is,0.5,Positive,1
a top strap alternative which from the,0.5,Positive,1
rumor seems to be something that was,0.0,Neutral,0
maybe a late addition to the packaging,-0.3,Negative,0
of the vision pro and just having the,0.0,Neutral,0
top strap offloads enough weight to make,0.25,Positive,1
it a significantly more comfortable,0.45,Positive,1
experience i'm disappointed that you,-0.75,Negative,0
can't have the knit solo strap with the,0.0,Neutral,0
top strap design because comfort-wise i,0.5,Positive,1
find this secondary dual strap option,-0.3,Negative,0
much more comfortable overall but the,0.3,Positive,1
knit strap option when leading back more,0.25,Positive,1
comfortable because of that wide surface,0.15000000000000002,Positive,1
area because of the ease of tightening i,0.0,Neutral,0
just like the visuals like the,0.0,Neutral,0
aesthetics and like the feel of the solo,0.0,Neutral,0
knit strap while the ergonomics of the,0.0,Neutral,0
dual strap are better and so i've taken,0.5,Positive,1
to using you know a velcro strap is,0.0,Neutral,0
actually the one that came with the big,0.0,Neutral,0
screen beyond and wrapping that around,0.0,Neutral,0
the top of the solo knit strap uh other,0.1875,Positive,1
people have you know 3d printed clips,0.0,Neutral,0
and bought additional solo knit straps,0.0,Neutral,0
to use as a top strap and however you do,0.5,Positive,1
it it's undeniable that the ergonomics,0.0,Neutral,0
of this headset could be better either,0.5,Positive,1
by removing weight from the front of it,0.0,Neutral,0
or putting some of the weight on the top,0.5,Positive,1
of the head with some type of side to,0.0,Neutral,0
side top strap or front to back top,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
strap um they acknowledge as much with,0.2,Positive,1
this secondary option i just wish this,-0.3,Negative,0
was connected to the solo knit strap so,0.0,Neutral,0
when we're talking about how usable a,0.0,Neutral,0
virtual desktop or the vision os,0.0,Neutral,0
applications are as an alternative or a,0.0,Neutral,0
uh a complement to using a desktop,0.0,Neutral,0
computer or a laptop computer today it's,0.0,Neutral,0
not just about the clarity and the pixel,0.0,Neutral,0
resolution of the virtual images or the,0.0,Neutral,0
virtual desktop that you see while,0.0,Neutral,0
wearing the headset ergonomics,0.0,Neutral,0
absolutely becomes a part of it and,0.2,Positive,1
despite the totally fine field of view,0.4166666666666667,Positive,1
inside this headset i think it's a,0.0,Neutral,0
little lower for me uh given the eye,-0.1875,Negative,0
relief than what i've been able to use,0.5,Positive,1
in the quest 3 and certainly most,0.5,Positive,1
noticeably a lower vertical field of,0.0,Neutral,0
view uh has a large sweet spot with some,0.28214285714285714,Positive,1
chromatic aberration on the outer 5%,0.0,Neutral,0
edges the lenses i feel like aren't as,0.0,Neutral,0
good as what's in the quest 3 or the,0.7,Positive,1
quest pro uh just because of how much,0.2,Positive,1
they have to magnify those 1.1 in micro,0.0,Neutral,0
oleds uh it's really about how long i,0.07500000000000001,Positive,1
can be in this headset and how long can,-0.05,Negative,0
i be in this headset in a lean forward,0.0,Neutral,0
activity when i have have a bluetooth,0.0,Neutral,0
keyboard or trackpad in front of me and,0.0,Neutral,0
i'm using it as a virtual monitor,0.0,Neutral,0
display um and i really couldn't use,0.2,Positive,1
this in a full day doing video editing i,0.35,Positive,1
could really go for an hour hour and a,0.2,Positive,1
half tops um kind of using it as uh an,0.21666666666666667,Positive,1
alternative to my big 4k display that i,0.0,Neutral,0
have for my desktop pc um which point i,0.0,Neutral,0
really started to feel the weight of the,0.2,Positive,1
headset uh even with battery plugged in,0.0,Neutral,0
had nothing to do with the you know 2,0.0,Neutral,0
and 1 half hour battery life of this or,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
the clarity of the image in front of me,0.0,Neutral,0
or the ice any eye strain it was really,0.2,Positive,1
just the weight of the headset that i,0.0,Neutral,0
was wearing another thing that's worth,0.3,Positive,1
mentioning is the variety of inputs that,0.0,Neutral,0
apple vision pro supports because in,0.0,Neutral,0
headset gaze and tap gesture while that,0.0,Neutral,0
is your primary way of interacting there,0.4,Positive,1
is direct touch as we demonstrated of,0.1,Positive,1
just putting your fingers through,0.0,Neutral,0
virtual keyboard and grabbing the,0.0,Neutral,0
handles for your virtual displays but if,0.0,Neutral,0
you're going to do any type of real,0.2,Positive,1
computing whether mirroring a laptop,0.0,Neutral,0
computer device or in native,0.0,Neutral,0
applications you're going to want to,0.0,Neutral,0
have at very least a bluetooth keyboard,-0.39,Negative,0
the apple magic keyboard is the one that,0.5,Positive,1
they recommend because not only does it,0.0,Neutral,0
work as a lightweight keyboard that you,0.0,Neutral,0
can throw in your bag for travel also is,0.0,Neutral,0
one of the devices like the macbook that,0.0,Neutral,0
the computer vision system recognizes is,0.0,Neutral,0
and throws up a little bit of augmented,-0.1875,Negative,0
reality on top in this case it's the the,0.5,Positive,1
autocorrect typing um text your text,0.0,Neutral,0
field floats above the magic keyboard,0.25,Positive,1
regardless of what orientation or where,0.0,Neutral,0
that keyboard's at there's also cursor,0.0,Neutral,0
input and this is where it's also a,0.0,Neutral,0
little bit frustrating because there is,-0.29375,Negative,0
trackpad support so you have apple magic,0.5,Positive,1
trackpad of course first party accessory,0.25,Positive,1
that once you uh pair it with vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
you get not a pinpoint cursor but a kind,0.6,Positive,1
of a circle circular cursor the,0.0,Neutral,0
equivalent of if you paired a trackpad,0.0,Neutral,0
or mouse with your ipad unlike pairing,0.0,Neutral,0
those input methods with the ipad though,0.0,Neutral,0
you cannot pair a bluetooth mouse with,0.0,Neutral,0
the vision pro it's just flat out not,-0.025,Negative,0
supported you know i have a logitech,0.0,Neutral,0
k380 which has a keyboard and a windows,0.0,Neutral,0
trackpad that windows trackpad will not,0.0,Neutral,0
pair the only trackpad that will pair is,0.0,Neutral,0
apple,0.0,Neutral,0
trackpads seems to be a strange design,-0.05,Negative,0
cision there now there is interesting uh,0.5,Positive,1
compatibility so uh handoff is a feature,0.0,Neutral,0
where if you're in a virtual desktop,0.0,Neutral,0
environment connected to your macbook or,0.0,Neutral,0
or your mac os device and you have,0.0,Neutral,0
vision os windows that cursor when,0.0,Neutral,0
you're using a trackpad will float,0.0,Neutral,0
seamlessly from one to the other now it,-0.012499999999999997,Negative,0
does that base on gaze and attention so,-0.8,Negative,0
it's not like if you have a window in,0.0,Neutral,0
front of you and a window that's you,0.0,Neutral,0
know 18 in separate from you it doesn't,0.0,Neutral,0
fly through the negative space the,0.25,Positive,1
cursor doesn't fly through there it,0.8,Positive,1
reaches the edge of your frame kind of,0.6,Positive,1
the edge of a window and the moment you,0.0,Neutral,0
gaze and look and focus at another,0.0,Neutral,0
window the trackpad then surfaces there,0.0,Neutral,0
so it's an instantaneous movement it's,0.0,Neutral,0
not representing the kind of zspace or,0.6,Positive,1
through xy zspace of uh the computing,0.0,Neutral,0
device so that's maybe a reason they,0.0,Neutral,0
didn't allow for you know the cursor,0.0,Neutral,0
support or bluetooth mouse support but i,0.0,Neutral,0
still want that there and while your,0.0,Neutral,0
mirror desktop if you have mac os device,0.0,Neutral,0
you can pair a mouse to that that mouse,0.0,Neutral,0
cursor will be locked inside your mac os,0.0,Neutral,0
window you won't be able to bring that,0.5,Positive,1
mouse cursor outside to vision os only,0.0,Neutral,0
if you use the trackpad on your macbook,0.0,Neutral,0
or apple magic trackpad will you have,0.5,Positive,1
that handoff ability to move the mouse,0.0,Neutral,0
um between windows it seems like this,0.0,Neutral,0
arbitrary design decision that it's one,-0.1,Negative,0
of those things we just don't know is it,0.0,Neutral,0
ever going to change they just not get,0.0,Neutral,0
to it in time or is this philosophically,0.0,Neutral,0
one of these things that they want to,0.0,Neutral,0
draw a line in the,0.0,Neutral,0
sand not sure i mean when we're talking,-0.28125,Negative,0
about the precision of input the mouse,0.0,Neutral,0
cursor is one of the most precise things,0.45,Positive,1
we've developed for human computer,0.05,Positive,1
interfacing gaze and pinch feels natural,0.1,Positive,1
but using something like scrubbing a,0.0,Neutral,0
video and moving the playhead scrubber i,0.0,Neutral,0
found that in vision pro i've had,0.0,Neutral,0
difficult time just getting precisely to,-0.04999999999999999,Negative,0
where i want it to be uh even with the,0.0,Neutral,0
trackpad the trackpad cursor great for,0.8,Positive,1
you know two fingers scrolling on a you,0.0,Neutral,0
know safari web browser but anytime i,0.0,Neutral,0
want extra pinpoint precision i can tell,0.0,Neutral,0
ui elements are inflated a little bit to,-0.1875,Negative,0
make hitting those touch points a little,-0.1875,Negative,0
bit or those gaze points a little bit,-0.1875,Negative,0
easier um and when that fails when ey,-0.5,Negative,0
tracking you know fails and i know i'm,-0.5,Negative,0
staring at a menu icon or a menu item,0.0,Neutral,0
and it's not highlighting and i have to,0.0,Neutral,0
kind of like move my eyeballs flutter,0.6,Positive,1
them up to get it to to move up that's,0.0,Neutral,0
where gaze and tap gets becomes a bit,0.0,Neutral,0
frustrating it's a place where i,-0.4,Negative,0
sometimes miss having the pinpoint,0.0,Neutral,0
precision and the responsiveness,0.0,Neutral,0
honestly of a track controller with a,0.6,Positive,1
raycast laser beam i know that's not,0.0,Neutral,0
going to be the best case best use case,1.0,Positive,1
for computing ubiquitously but gaming,0.0,Neutral,0
you still kind of need a track,0.6,Positive,1
controller i think and even for,0.0,Neutral,0
navigating a lot of ui there are times,0.0,Neutral,0
where i i want that precision i want all,0.0,Neutral,0
the m all the modals you know multimodal,0.0,Neutral,0
of being i and finger tapping they've,0.0,Neutral,0
done a lot of work to make it feel good,0.7,Positive,1
but give me that option of keyboard ie,0.0,Neutral,0
tapping trackpad mouse and whatever is,0.0,Neutral,0
best fit for the user so i don't have to,0.7,Positive,1
change the way i operate to make the,0.0,Neutral,0
consist the computer system work best,1.0,Positive,1
for me that been my experience for what,0.0,Neutral,0
i would call lean forward activities,0.0,Neutral,0
where i'm actively engaged in trying to,-0.13333333333333333,Negative,0
do computing as an alternative to what i,0.0,Neutral,0
may have available at home but the,0.4,Positive,1
places where apple vision pro really,0.2,Positive,1
shines are lean backward activities,0.0,Neutral,0
where i normally would be sitting on a,0.15,Positive,1
couch using a tablet or watching a big,0.0,Neutral,0
screen tv and watching a movie at home,0.0,Neutral,0
and so let's head back to the studio and,0.0,Neutral,0
give you a demonstration of what media,0.0,Neutral,0
viewing is like in apple vision pro so,0.0,Neutral,0
one of my favorite things to do with,0.5,Positive,1
vision pro is watch media and of course,0.0,Neutral,0
there are all types of media that you,0.0,Neutral,0
can enjoy in headset from photos to,0.4,Positive,1
videos to movies to tv shows and each of,0.0,Neutral,0
those you can enjoy in a bunch of,0.4,Positive,1
different ways i want to run through,0.0,Neutral,0
some of the peculiars of watching video,0.0,Neutral,0
in apple vision pro uh on a base level i,-0.8,Negative,0
can open an application like juno which,0.0,Neutral,0
is a front end for uh youtube,0.0,Neutral,0
essentially a youtube player and it kind,0.3,Positive,1
of is like a floating video player where,0.0,Neutral,0
i can play a video and you have the same,0.0,Neutral,0
controls as if you this was a safari,0.0,Neutral,0
window you can resize it by grabbing the,0.0,Neutral,0
edge corner or using two hands to resize,0.0,Neutral,0
the window you can move it closer and,0.0,Neutral,0
for further back and here's an,0.0,Neutral,0
interesting thing that really is only,0.25,Positive,1
relevant to the type of media that you,0.4,Positive,1
might watch in uh a headset where you,0.0,Neutral,0
have uh basically a a a a 3d,0.0,Neutral,0
representation of this video player the,0.0,Neutral,0
video itself isn't 3d but it exists in,0.0,Neutral,0
zspace in 3d space and so not only do i,0.0,Neutral,0
have to think about how big i want this,0.0,Neutral,0
video player to be i also need to think,0.0,Neutral,0
about how close and how or how far away,0.1,Positive,1
i might want to enjoy this video how,0.4,Positive,1
much i want my eyes to actually converge,0.1,Positive,1
on the image um do i want to have more,0.5,Positive,1
like a laptop or ipad experience where,0.0,Neutral,0
i'm bringing a video player up close and,0.0,Neutral,0
i can still make it big but it's like,0.0,Neutral,0
having like you know maybe a 40inch,0.0,Neutral,0
computer monitor in front of you uh i,0.0,Neutral,0
find that little bit more straining than,0.15625,Positive,1
pushing the media player back and having,0.0,Neutral,0
the largest screen i can make it but as,0.0,Neutral,0
far away from me as possible my eyes are,0.05,Positive,1
a little bit more relaxed it's like,0.15625,Positive,1
having this video projected on a cinema,0.0,Neutral,0
screen it's not just about the density,0.0,Neutral,0
of the pixels it really also is about,0.2,Positive,1
the comfort for my eyes and how i'm,0.0,Neutral,0
looking and gazing on the video content,0.0,Neutral,0
and not only is that for videos that you,0.0,Neutral,0
can load up in a web browser or in,0.0,Neutral,0
thirdparty applications but also in,0.0,Neutral,0
apple tv as well and so same thing this,0.0,Neutral,0
is a trailer brought up in apple tv and,0.0,Neutral,0
rather than having it play floating in,0.0,Neutral,0
my space in the apple tv application you,0.0,Neutral,0
can,0.0,Neutral,0
actually load up environments where this,0.0,Neutral,0
video is playing in so there's a full,0.35,Positive,1
cinem environment which is unique to the,0.375,Positive,1
apple tv application where it does feel,0.0,Neutral,0
like you're in a giant cinema space,0.0,Neutral,0
there are no chairs though i do see my,0.0,Neutral,0
hands included in here and you actually,0.0,Neutral,0
see the ceiling in the floor react to,0.0,Neutral,0
the image on the screen it's,0.0,Neutral,0
illuminating that we've seen this in,0.0,Neutral,0
other you know immersive video players,-0.125,Negative,0
before uh on other headsets and the,-0.125,Negative,0
implementation here is really really,0.2,Positive,1
compelling uh you can also if you don't,0.3,Positive,1
want to use a cinnamon environment a,0.0,Neutral,0
trick is to also pull up the other ver,-0.125,Negative,0
of environment,0.0,Neutral,0
so if i open up my home view and load up,0.0,Neutral,0
the immersive environments here having,0.0,Neutral,0
the video player float in yos or mount,0.0,Neutral,0
hood in the default immersive,0.0,Neutral,0
environment isn't actually as compelling,0.3,Positive,1
as going into the apple tv's,0.0,Neutral,0
implementation of that immersive,0.0,Neutral,0
environment where i can have this,0.0,Neutral,0
playing in yosity and it actually again,0.0,Neutral,0
has the video illuminating the actual,0.0,Neutral,0
environment uh there are some,0.0,Neutral,0
restrictions in this fully focused mode,0.0,Neutral,0
i can't multitask i can't bring in other,-0.125,Negative,0
windows it's a purely a media playing,0.21428571428571427,Positive,1
mode and these this version of the,0.0,Neutral,0
immersive environments is locked only to,0.0,Neutral,0
apple tv but i've quite enjoyed you know,0.5,Positive,1
playing a video uh in in in mount hood,0.0,Neutral,0
for example selecting mount hood as my,0.0,Neutral,0
mive environment playing it in the dark,-0.15,Negative,0
and you can actually see the video here,0.0,Neutral,0
the movie trailer playing on top of the,0.5,Positive,1
lake of mount hood you can see the,0.0,Neutral,0
reflections looking really nice on top,0.55,Positive,1
of that lake it looks super super cool,0.33888888888888885,Positive,1
now one thing where i feel like media,0.0,Neutral,0
playback could be included one area is,0.0,Neutral,0
just in navigating the interface i feel,0.0,Neutral,0
like this 2d representation,0.0,Neutral,0
of a playback bar of that play head,0.0,Neutral,0
feels a little bit archaic in vision pro,-0.1875,Negative,0
i can look at the scrub bar you know tap,0.0,Neutral,0
and move it back and forth but it's not,0.0,Neutral,0
the same as pressing my finger on a,0.0,Neutral,0
screen and scrubbing back i feel like,0.0,Neutral,0
having the passive haptics of my finger,0.0,Neutral,0
on a scrub bar on a a piece of glass,0.0,Neutral,0
actually allows me more find control as,0.25,Positive,1
if i was using a mouse to to scrub um,0.0,Neutral,0
back and forth pinching and,0.0,Neutral,0
looking to scrub back and forth you know,0.0,Neutral,0
it's kind of like the difference between,0.6,Positive,1
trying to draw a perfect circle in the,1.0,Positive,1
air versus drawing a perfect circle,1.0,Positive,1
again on a white sheet of paper you're,0.0,Neutral,0
going to get more precision when you,0.5,Positive,1
have some type of haptic response so i'd,0.0,Neutral,0
like to see a more developed version of,0.3,Positive,1
this interface maybe it's a time to a,0.0,Neutral,0
place to bring back more skew morphism i,0.25,Positive,1
could see you know for example maybe,0.0,Neutral,0
something can grab and and slowly move,-0.30000000000000004,Negative,0
in front of me having it floating there,0.0,Neutral,0
where i need to look at it and scrub,0.0,Neutral,0
something back and forth on a long video,-0.025,Negative,0
i've there are many times where it just,0.5,Positive,1
jumps back and forth and it's been a,0.0,Neutral,0
little bit frustrating uh now the last,-0.19583333333333333,Negative,0
type of video i also wanted to,0.0,Neutral,0
demonstrate was spatial video and uh,0.0,Neutral,0
these are videos captured either uh with,0.0,Neutral,0
the headset itself with the stereo,0.0,Neutral,0
cameras or uh with a current generation,0.0,Neutral,0
iphone 15 pro so if you load up iphone,0.0,Neutral,0
15 pro and you have uh the video mode,0.0,Neutral,0
you can actually see a spatial capture,0.0,Neutral,0
button there and you can press,0.0,Neutral,0
record and you can then capture what's,0.0,Neutral,0
essentially a stereoscopic video now,0.0,Neutral,0
it's not a full vr 180 video it doesn't,-0.175,Negative,0
fill your entire field of view it's kind,0.3,Positive,1
of the equivalent of that window iphone,0.0,Neutral,0
that you were holding that window camera,0.0,Neutral,0
camera that you're holding to to watch,0.0,Neutral,0
those videos and i found them really,0.2,Positive,1
really compelling to watch memories of,0.3,Positive,1
my family my daughter my dad here and i,0.0,Neutral,0
can see it in my perspective in full 3d,0.35,Positive,1
i can see the depth and while there's no,0.0,Neutral,0
parx i can't look around it for example,0.0,Neutral,0
uh it does make it feel more real hair,0.35,Positive,1
light caught on hair volumetric effects,0.4,Positive,1
you know smoke coming out of a birthday,0.0,Neutral,0
candle all look really really powerful,0.3,Positive,1
in side by side stereo video now you can,0.0,Neutral,0
also capture it with the headset itself,0.0,Neutral,0
and that's by using the uh the capture,0.0,Neutral,0
the top button on the top left of the,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
vision pro so if i press that i can,0.0,Neutral,0
actually toggle a video capture mode and,0.0,Neutral,0
here i can actually start recording a,0.0,Neutral,0
spatial video from my perspective now,0.0,Neutral,0
this is more full vr1 a more full field,0.42500000000000004,Positive,1
of view and here i'm being very careful,-0.13,Negative,0
how i'm capturing this because any type,0.0,Neutral,0
of rotation any type of fast movement is,0.2,Positive,1
going to make playing back that video,0.0,Neutral,0
uncomfortable and apple doesn't do a ton,-0.5,Negative,0
to give you tips or advise you on the,0.0,Neutral,0
best way to capture this type of,1.0,Positive,1
immersive spatial video you can see i'm,0.0,Neutral,0
playing it back right now and if i was,0.14285714285714285,Positive,1
doing a ton of head movements this would,0.0,Neutral,0
be really uncomfortable to watch it does,-0.5,Negative,0
feel really immersive because it's more,0.35,Positive,1
of that feeling of that first person,0.25,Positive,1
view not holding up a camera view um and,0.0,Neutral,0
so i've had fun experimenting going back,0.15,Positive,1
and forth between using the phone and,0.0,Neutral,0
using the headset to capture a spatial,0.0,Neutral,0
video i think the stuff captured with,0.0,Neutral,0
the phone feels like it's something i'm,0.0,Neutral,0
going to do more frequently i don't see,0.3,Positive,1
myself wearing this headset to birthday,0.0,Neutral,0
parties wearing it around the house but,0.0,Neutral,0
i do see myself toggling on that spatial,0.0,Neutral,0
video toggle in uh the photo in the,0.0,Neutral,0
camera app and do using that uh even if,0.0,Neutral,0
it's capturing at just 1080 resolution,0.0,Neutral,0
so the one place where i feel like apple,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro almost justifies its entire,0.0,Neutral,0
cost it's killer application is in,0.0,Neutral,0
watching media and it's a place where we,0.0,Neutral,0
we've known headsets can be great media,0.8,Positive,1
viewing devices all the way back to you,0.0,Neutral,0
know even gear vr we were watching,0.0,Neutral,0
videos in headset with three degrees of,0.0,Neutral,0
freedom and tracking but waiting for a,0.0,Neutral,0
point where the resolution and the,0.0,Neutral,0
clarity of the image and just the,0.0,Neutral,0
seamlessness of the experience would,0.0,Neutral,0
make,0.0,Neutral,0
it the equivalent of if not better than,-0.25,Negative,0
the kind of tv that you would buy for,0.6,Positive,1
your home to watch at home uh that you,0.0,Neutral,0
might spend you know thousands of,0.0,Neutral,0
dollars on a highquality home theater,0.0,Neutral,0
setup and i felt like we got close to,0.0,Neutral,0
that with the quest 3 and certainly the,0.21428571428571427,Positive,1
big screen beyond one of the things i,0.0,Neutral,0
love doing big screen beyond was,0.25,Positive,1
watching movies on there but as you saw,0.0,Neutral,0
in my review of that it was tethered to,0.0,Neutral,0
not only the computer but also my steam,0.0,Neutral,0
vr trackers and while great for sitting,0.8,Positive,1
in my office chair in my home office,0.0,Neutral,0
watching a movie um i really wanted that,0.2,Positive,1
on the couch or in bed and the apple,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro gives me that i mean i love,0.09375,Positive,1
watching movies on the quest 3 as well,0.0,Neutral,0
and for 500 being able to load,0.5,Positive,1
something and watch in in you know,0.0,Neutral,0
skybox video player it is a totally,0.0,Neutral,0
enjoyable experience here in the vision,0.5,Positive,1
pro it feels like a cut above not only,0.0,Neutral,0
because of the immersive environments,0.0,Neutral,0
that apple tv allows you to do so the,0.0,Neutral,0
variance of the immersive environments,0.0,Neutral,0
that they've built into the uh the the,0.0,Neutral,0
shared space um but also the aversions,0.0,Neutral,0
in exclusive to apple tv where you can,0.0,Neutral,0
put the display over the lake of mount,0.0,Neutral,0
hood or you know floating on top of the,0.5,Positive,1
clouds above a a hawaiian volcano like,0.0,Neutral,0
those immersive experience immersive,0.0,Neutral,0
environments with 4k hdr and 3d high,0.16,Positive,1
frame rate movies in apple vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
are unsurpassed you're not getting you,0.0,Neutral,0
know half the frames or half the,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
resolution even when you're buying a 3d,0.0,Neutral,0
movie you know on a 3d blu-ray disc here,0.0,Neutral,0
you're actually getting you know the,0.0,Neutral,0
same amount of images at full resolution,0.175,Positive,1
per eye and it's the only place where,0.0,Neutral,0
you can find high frame rate actually in,0.08,Positive,1
home video home entertainment market for,0.0,Neutral,0
things like avatar and the ang le film,0.0,Neutral,0
that he made at full,0.35,Positive,1
60fps um and applications like imax oh,0.0,Neutral,0
my goodness it's the one time where i,0.0,Neutral,0
felt like if i had the choice between,0.0,Neutral,0
paying 20 to go to an imax theater to,0.0,Neutral,0
watch the full 4x3 imax aspect ratio,0.35,Positive,1
documentary or renting it and watching,0.0,Neutral,0
it in headset i would actually prefer,0.0,Neutral,0
watching it in headset there feel,0.0,Neutral,0
there's nothing that feels compromised,0.0,Neutral,0
in headset in apple vision pro for the,0.0,Neutral,0
imac in the imax app when compared to,0.0,Neutral,0
going to the imax theater it's full b,0.35,Positive,1
bit rate full resolution full aspect,0.35,Positive,1
ratio i can choose the seat that i like,0.0,Neutral,0
right you know not right under the,0.07142857142857142,Positive,1
screen and when using you know airpod,0.0,Neutral,0
pros or even using the built-in audio it,0.0,Neutral,0
feels like a premium realistic imax,0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
experience no,0.0,Neutral,0
compromises uh the glare in the lenses,0.0,Neutral,0
is present but much diminished than uh i,0.1,Positive,1
think people are reporting and,0.0,Neutral,0
especially compared to the glare i saw,0.0,Neutral,0
in like big screen beyond using micro,0.0,Neutral,0
oled uh panels it's much less an issue,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
here there does seem to be though a,0.0,Neutral,0
strange siloing of some of the media,-0.05,Negative,0
viewing experiences though like you're,0.0,Neutral,0
going to have applications that are the,0.0,Neutral,0
ipad versions of those streaming,0.0,Neutral,0
services so they're just going to be,0.0,Neutral,0
floating windows and all the only,0.0,Neutral,0
immersive environments you can use are,0.0,Neutral,0
the ones baked into uh apple vision in,0.0,Neutral,0
their applications or environments list,0.0,Neutral,0
apple tv seems to have a leg up on the,0.0,Neutral,0
other streaming services in terms of the,-0.125,Negative,0
environments they can use uh and then,0.0,Neutral,0
third parties have their environments,0.0,Neutral,0
like disney plus has an array of them,0.0,Neutral,0
but you can't view other media in disney,-0.125,Negative,0
plus and so you know if you want to,0.0,Neutral,0
watch avatar for example uh you want to,0.0,Neutral,0
watch it in the apple cinema environment,0.0,Neutral,0
you got to buy the apple tv version you,0.0,Neutral,0
can't just stream the disney plus,0.0,Neutral,0
version,0.0,Neutral,0
and so these seem to be inconsistencies,-0.1,Negative,0
and maybe intentionally designed,0.0,Neutral,0
differentiation in the type of,0.0,Neutral,0
experiences that users will just have to,0.0,Neutral,0
figure out and navigate like you know,0.0,Neutral,0
can i watch youtube in the headset yes,0.0,Neutral,0
but out of the box only through a safari,0.0,Neutral,0
browser uh until google releases an,0.0,Neutral,0
official youtube app or you can pay for,0.0,Neutral,0
the excellent juno app which is a,1.0,Positive,1
standalone youtube viewer uh but doesn't,0.0,Neutral,0
have all the features i think and ative,0.0,Neutral,0
youtube viewer might have in terms of,0.0,Neutral,0
cashing uh videos so we're still a,0.0,Neutral,0
little bit in the early days of media,-0.04375,Negative,0
viewing and something that they're going,0.0,Neutral,0
to have to figure out is what is the,0.0,Neutral,0
shared experience of watching a movie,0.0,Neutral,0
going to be because right now it's a,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
pretty isolating experience uh,0.25,Positive,1
especially in immersive environments,0.0,Neutral,0
there is share play so there is,0.0,Neutral,0
something right out of the box if other,0.08035714285714285,Positive,1
people have a headset or don't have a,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro you can you know start a,0.0,Neutral,0
facetime call with them and link up,0.0,Neutral,0
through their apple tv or their vision,0.0,Neutral,0
pro uh the share play sync so uh if they,0.0,Neutral,0
have purchased the same movie uh you can,0.0,Neutral,0
actually sync it up and uh either viewer,0.0,Neutral,0
can remotely uh adjust the playhead and,-0.1,Negative,0
change chapters and have that kind of,0.6,Positive,1
shared experience but it's not quite the,0.0,Neutral,0
same as something like big screen where,0.0,Neutral,0
you have you know embodied avatars in,0.0,Neutral,0
the virtual cinema share play for apple,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro users right now is limited,0.10714285714285714,Positive,1
between tiled personas which is,0.0,Neutral,0
something we should dive into it's your,0.0,Neutral,0
the apple equivalent of avatars uh and,0.0,Neutral,0
so let's actually talk about how those,0.0,Neutral,0
personas are,0.0,Neutral,0
music,0.0,Neutral,0
created so now that i've done the scan,0.0,Neutral,0
it's creating my persona and it does it,0.0,Neutral,0
relatively quickly surprisingly quickly,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
for what it needed and you know what,0.0,Neutral,0
there it goes that's me very quickly,0.43333333333333335,Positive,1
captured uh using the front cameras of,0.0,Neutral,0
the vision pro you can see my hands are,0.0,Neutral,0
captured as well uh you can do a little,-0.1875,Negative,0
bit of adjustments so you can change the,0.0,Neutral,0
lighting studio lighting uh contour,0.0,Neutral,0
lighting and then also change the color,0.0,Neutral,0
temperature just a little bit as well as,-0.1875,Negative,0
the brightness but not a lot of,0.0,Neutral,0
customization options so you can of,0.0,Neutral,0
course add glasses and there is a,0.0,Neutral,0
selection of them all the glasses you'll,0.0,Neutral,0
notice are also um translucent so you're,0.0,Neutral,0
not going to get the full color or,0.35,Positive,1
texture of your glasses but it's very,0.2,Positive,1
quick and pretty effective i'm actually,0.2958333333333333,Positive,1
going to open a thirdparty application,0.0,Neutral,0
called persona studio that someone's,0.0,Neutral,0
created that let me better view the,0.5,Positive,1
persona and all the details it's,0.0,Neutral,0
captured not only just the texture and,0.0,Neutral,0
the geometry of my face and even the,0.0,Neutral,0
hair and the general silhouette and a,0.05000000000000002,Positive,1
really quick capture cuz it was less,0.08333333333333333,Positive,1
than 30 seconds to get all that but the,0.0,Neutral,0
the rigging of my facial expressions to,0.0,Neutral,0
this model uh the fact that they can get,0.0,Neutral,0
my eye movements of course with the eye,0.0,Neutral,0
tracking the mouth movements even the,0.0,Neutral,0
scrunch of the nose and the eyebrows the,0.0,Neutral,0
subtle lip curl you can see teeth and if,-0.3333333333333333,Negative,0
i stick my tongue out like that the,0.0,Neutral,0
tongue sticks out but it's not my real,0.2,Positive,1
tongue cuz actually never got to scan,0.0,Neutral,0
the inside of my my mouth now they're,0.0,Neutral,0
also doing some tricks here like adding,0.0,Neutral,0
some noise and grain to the persona as,0.0,Neutral,0
well as some vignetting to just hide,0.0,Neutral,0
some of the lack of detail it does,0.0,Neutral,0
capture a little bit your top of what,0.15625,Positive,1
you're the shirt you're wearing as well,0.0,Neutral,0
but this is much more uh subtle of,0.08333333333333334,Positive,1
detail um nuance uh of animation that,0.0,Neutral,0
you're getting in this than apple's,0.0,Neutral,0
mimoji system that it would normally,0.15,Positive,1
capture with the the front of an an,0.0,Neutral,0
iphone and this background here is just,0.0,Neutral,0
generic background what you're getting,0.0,Neutral,0
here is essentially if you're using an,0.0,Neutral,0
ipad compatible app or anything that's,0.0,Neutral,0
going to require a front-facing camera,0.0,Neutral,0
it's going to send them this persona,0.0,Neutral,0
feed and using this while of course,0.0,Neutral,0
while in headset has been totally,0.0,Neutral,0
sufficient to communicate i think it's,0.0,Neutral,0
been far more effective in communicating,0.39999999999999997,Positive,1
my thoughts and expressions and having a,0.0,Neutral,0
a conversation with someone who's not,0.0,Neutral,0
wearing a headset uh than a more,0.5,Positive,1
cartoonish like avatar now i do wish,0.0,Neutral,0
there maybe were more customization,0.5,Positive,1
options addition to the glasses but,0.0,Neutral,0
right now they're no sliders you know,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
it's it's not like a role playing game,-0.4,Negative,0
where you're going to be tweaking this,0.0,Neutral,0
they want this to be as accurate uh as a,0.4000000000000001,Positive,1
representation of you your real self as,0.2,Positive,1
possible um and this is even supposed to,0.0,Neutral,0
be better in the coming versions there's,0.5,Positive,1
a 1.1 beta where people have reported,0.0,Neutral,0
much improved persona likenesses uh and,0.2,Positive,1
that's why they're calling this a beta,0.0,Neutral,0
application right now but the other,0.08035714285714285,Positive,1
place that the persona and your persona,0.0,Neutral,0
is used is also in the eyesight camera,0.0,Neutral,0
and so this is kind of the the,0.6,Positive,1
controversial feature that apple put in,0.55,Positive,1
vision pro putting a oled screen on the,0.0,Neutral,0
exterior of the headset so that people,0.0,Neutral,0
out in the world can still communicate,0.0,Neutral,0
with you and if i'm walking up to a,0.0,Neutral,0
camera right now and i have no other,0.17410714285714285,Positive,1
application it actually recognizes that,0.0,Neutral,0
there's someone i'm looking at so as,0.0,Neutral,0
joey fades in for me my eyes fade out,0.0,Neutral,0
for him i have no idea i can't see,0.0,Neutral,0
what's on this lenticular screen right,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
now but knowing there's this one toone,0.0,Neutral,0
reciprocal action where as i make eye,0.1,Positive,1
contact with people in the world they,0.0,Neutral,0
see my eyes as as well and it's well,0.0,Neutral,0
even though it's low resolution and,0.0,Neutral,0
they've you know kind of filtered it,0.6,Positive,1
behind this lular screen to give it the,-0.4,Negative,0
illusion of depth so it's not just on,0.0,Neutral,0
the the surface of the glass but it's,0.0,Neutral,0
receded just a little bit that's been,-0.1875,Negative,0
sufficient at home to have conversations,0.0,Neutral,0
with someone else and let people know,0.0,Neutral,0
that i'm not just in my own world i can,0.6,Positive,1
still engage with them you can toggle on,0.0,Neutral,0
and off that people awareness and it's,0.0,Neutral,0
pretty sensitive sensitive to to a point,0.15,Positive,1
where i might be again looking at,0.0,Neutral,0
digital uh content but even the face of,0.0,Neutral,0
like my child on the phone will actually,0.0,Neutral,0
fade in that,0.0,Neutral,0
image and i'll think that that's a,0.0,Neutral,0
person that i'm looking at and my eyes,0.0,Neutral,0
will fade out for them now it was super,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
quick for me to create this persona and,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
we've been wondering what the the limits,0.0,Neutral,0
of this are and i've seen people you,0.0,Neutral,0
know you can wear hats some people have,0.0,Neutral,0
tried to put on parts of you know their,0.0,Neutral,0
cosplay a little bit of makeup and you,-0.1875,Negative,0
can capture some of those details at,0.0,Neutral,0
some point if you're wearing a full mask,0.35,Positive,1
they're not going to let you capture,0.0,Neutral,0
that as your persona and if you have,0.0,Neutral,0
optic id turned on it does scan your,0.0,Neutral,0
retina before you begin the process but,0.0,Neutral,0
if you have a buddy you can actually,0.0,Neutral,0
scan their face as your persona because,0.0,Neutral,0
the outside cameras don't know what you,0.0,Neutral,0
look like they're just looking for a,0.0,Neutral,0
face looking for you to you know turn,0.0,Neutral,0
and scan and and do those actions and,0.0,Neutral,0
smile,0.3,Positive,1
so you can actually take off the headset,0.0,Neutral,0
give it to someone else scan their face,0.0,Neutral,0
put it on and it's super trippy to wear,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
your headset get on a facetime call use,0.0,Neutral,0
this persona studio and basically have,0.0,Neutral,0
you animate someone else's face it is,0.0,Neutral,0
possible right now it's one of those,0.14285714285714285,Positive,1
weird artifacts of their avatar,-0.5,Negative,0
generation and as fun as it might be to,0.3,Positive,1
mess around with generating personas and,-0.175,Negative,0
kind of dipping into the uncanny valley,0.6,Positive,1
i want to reiterate that the personas,0.0,Neutral,0
technology is maybe one of the most,0.5,Positive,1
impressive parts of what apple has made,1.0,Positive,1
for vision pro the fact that you can,0.0,Neutral,0
generate them in headset without you,0.0,Neutral,0
know any type of large capture array,0.21428571428571427,Positive,1
that they can be rigged to the skeletal,0.0,Neutral,0
model of what they think your face is in,0.0,Neutral,0
under 30 seconds and capture,0.0,Neutral,0
the nuances of your expressions,0.0,Neutral,0
especially you know your lip curl your,0.0,Neutral,0
mouth movements your eyebrow movements,0.0,Neutral,0
yes it does dip into the uncanny valley,0.0,Neutral,0
and that's because they're going for a,0.0,Neutral,0
photo real representation and you can,0.2,Positive,1
argue that maybe they should have gone,0.0,Neutral,0
with something that was more stylized,0.5,Positive,1
like you know avatars that you could,0.0,Neutral,0
customize in in any other you know,-0.125,Negative,0
virtual reality application but the fact,0.0,Neutral,0
that they shot for photo real and made,0.2,Positive,1
something that from an animation,0.0,Neutral,0
standpoint is believable and in a,0.5,Positive,1
communication standpoint does,0.0,Neutral,0
communicate everything that i would,0.0,Neutral,0
might i would want a facial expression,0.0,Neutral,0
to communicate i think is an incredible,0.9,Positive,1
uh leap um forward for avatar generation,0.0,Neutral,0
and for these type of mixed reality and,0.0,Neutral,0
virtual reality avatars um it seems like,0.0,Neutral,0
they're getting around people you know,0.0,Neutral,0
maybe generating false avatars by just,-0.4000000000000001,Negative,0
requiring people to generate new,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
personas every so often if you're going,0.0,Neutral,0
to update to version 1.1 whenever that,0.0,Neutral,0
comes out you're going to have to,0.0,Neutral,0
generate a new persona and you're not,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
able to save your personas and so you,0.5,Positive,1
know it's it's a way it's a passive way,0.0,Neutral,0
for them to ensure that as you're using,0.0,Neutral,0
your vision pro it's your persona your,0.0,Neutral,0
representation is just going to be as,0.0,Neutral,0
close to a contemporary representation,0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
of you as possible uh and it's also as,0.0,Neutral,0
we go back to the earlier discussion,0.0,Neutral,0
it's how they're doing uh any type of,0.0,Neutral,0
social aspect uh any type of multiplayer,0.03333333333333333,Positive,1
any type of a shared experience in,0.0,Neutral,0
headset right now which admittedly is,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
still very limited if you go back to,-0.04642857142857143,Negative,0
wwdc and the documentation and the,0.0,Neutral,0
developer sessions they released,0.0,Neutral,0
announcing the shareplay protocol you,0.0,Neutral,0
can see that there are supposed to be,0.0,Neutral,0
eventually experiences where you can,0.0,Neutral,0
have a bunch of personas not necessarily,0.0,Neutral,0
in those square tiles but just floating,0.0,Neutral,0
in space uh for people to remotely,-0.1,Negative,0
interact with either a single screen in,-0.07142857142857142,Negative,0
front of them be surrounded around a 3d,0.0,Neutral,0
object to discuss or in a kind of,0.6,Positive,1
semicircle pattern these different,0.0,Neutral,0
arrangements and they got the spatial,0.0,Neutral,0
audio part of that figured out they got,0.0,Neutral,0
the persona part of that kind of figured,0.6,Positive,1
out but implementation of the share play,0.0,Neutral,0
extensions and experiences is not just,0.0,Neutral,0
there yet i mean in applications like,-0.3125,Negative,0
jigspace you see you know a notification,0.0,Neutral,0
that says sharea share play is coming,0.0,Neutral,0
they're going to have some version of,0.0,Neutral,0
multiplayer um uh um remote,-0.1,Negative,0
collaboration um but a month into the,0.0,Neutral,0
launch we're not seeing a lot of that,0.0,Neutral,0
and we don't know going forward what the,0.0,Neutral,0
limits of that will be because if it's,0.0,Neutral,0
just going to be floating personas,0.0,Neutral,0
around a 3d object with with some hands,0.0,Neutral,0
in there that's not the kind of full,0.475,Positive,1
embodiment that you can even do now on,0.0,Neutral,0
the quest you know in your quest home,0.0,Neutral,0
environment where you can invite your,0.0,Neutral,0
friends into your home virtual space and,0.0,Neutral,0
the system right now doesn't seem to,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
have a way of doing collocation that's,0.0,Neutral,0
the idea of having iners people wearing,0.0,Neutral,0
headsets using vision os using the,0.0,Neutral,0
shared system where the spatial anchors,0.0,Neutral,0
are then synced up so that what they're,0.0,Neutral,0
looking at is from their relative,0.0,Neutral,0
perspective the same interface the same,0.0,Neutral,0
object the same web browser windows same,0.0,Neutral,0
3d model and can interact with that,0.0,Neutral,0
that's something that's actually,0.0,Neutral,0
available right now on the quest,0.34285714285714286,Positive,1
platform in games you can play demio and,0.0,Neutral,0
have people wearing headsets in the same,0.0,Neutral,0
room and then see the same game board um,-0.2,Negative,0
maybe they just apple doesn't expect a,0.0,Neutral,0
ton of people to be wearing apple vision,0.0,Neutral,0
pros in the same physical space yet,0.0,Neutral,0
collocation i think is going to be a,0.0,Neutral,0
really important part of mixed reality,0.2,Positive,1
uh experiences and so hopefully we'll,0.0,Neutral,0
see more of that maybe at gdc maybe at,0.5,Positive,1
wwdc later this year so as we near the,0.05,Positive,1
end of our discussion and review of,0.0,Neutral,0
apple vision pro i want to talk about,0.0,Neutral,0
some of the things it's been great at,0.8,Positive,1
and some of the things it's not been,0.0,Neutral,0
great at in some interesting anecdotes,0.65,Positive,1
that we've learned uh from using it this,0.0,Neutral,0
past month uh let's start with what it's,-0.25,Negative,0
not great at because this is not a,-0.4,Negative,0
gaming device and as much as people may,0.2,Positive,1
want to compare meta quest 3 with apple,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro they're not in the same,0.0,Neutral,0
category i really think about the,0.2,Positive,1
analogy of one is a game console like,-0.4,Negative,0
nintendo switch and one is a full,0.35,Positive,1
computer that a macbook pro that you're,0.0,Neutral,0
essentially buying for productivity that,0.0,Neutral,0
maybe isn't great at games but great at,0.8,Positive,1
productivity applications and the other,-0.125,Negative,0
thing is and the other headset qu 3 may,-0.125,Negative,0
be great at games and is great at games,0.8,Positive,1
uh but maybe not great at the computing,-0.4,Negative,0
side of things um it's also i think,0.0,Neutral,0
appropriate that apple isn't calling,0.5,Positive,1
this a virtual reality headset because,0.0,Neutral,0
there aren't a lot of things that you do,0.0,Neutral,0
in this that are fully immersive i,0.0,Neutral,0
really think of the immersive,0.2,Positive,1
environments that you can toggle and and,0.0,Neutral,0
dial in using the digital crown more is,0.25,Positive,1
the the mixed reality equivalent of,0.0,Neutral,0
wallpapers they're a way to isolate you,0.0,Neutral,0
while you're computing you're still in,0.0,Neutral,0
your your physical environment and,0.0,Neutral,0
that's why the uh the people awareness,0.0,Neutral,0
pops up that's why eyesight works um but,0.0,Neutral,0
you're not really transported to be,-0.1,Negative,0
interacting in that space it's really,0.2,Positive,1
just kind of background and there are,0.6,Positive,1
supposed to be full vr applications uh,0.35,Positive,1
for this you know developers are working,0.0,Neutral,0
on it you know there's going to be wreck,0.0,Neutral,0
room at some point in apple vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
and i don't know if without track,0.0,Neutral,0
controllers those experiences are going,0.0,Neutral,0
to be as resp responsive or as immersive,0.0,Neutral,0
as with what you get with having a thumb,0.0,Neutral,0
stick and trigger buttons cuz when,0.0,Neutral,0
people play games they're going to want,0.0,Neutral,0
to press a trigger or do fire a blaster,0.0,Neutral,0
they're going to want to hold something,0.0,Neutral,0
feel the passive haptics of having a,0.0,Neutral,0
controller in their hand to swing around,0.0,Neutral,0
a sword and maybe it's apple's,0.0,Neutral,0
philosophy that at some point hand,0.0,Neutral,0
tracking becomes good enough that you,0.35,Positive,1
don't need an active track controller,-0.13333333333333333,Negative,0
that you can pick up a passive thing you,0.0,Neutral,0
know uh a a a cylinder a small thing on,-0.25,Negative,0
your tabletop that isn't tracked and it,0.0,Neutral,0
works as a sword i don't know what their,0.0,Neutral,0
plan is going forward but the games they,0.0,Neutral,0
have right now feel more like the casual,0.09523809523809519,Positive,1
games it honestly feels like you know,0.6,Positive,1
smartphone games where uh i wish i could,0.0,Neutral,0
play them with a bluetooth controller or,0.0,Neutral,0
it's best played with a bluetooth,1.0,Positive,1
controller the onscreen native controls,0.0,Neutral,0
are not optimal the app selection also a,0.0,Neutral,0
month into launch seems like it's slow,-0.30000000000000004,Negative,0
growing um a new platform form i get,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
that uh and as of right now there are,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
over a thousand applications uh that are,0.0,Neutral,0
native to vision os so already a couple,0.0,Neutral,0
hundred more than the 600 plus they had,0.5,Positive,1
uh a month ago but app discovery has,0.0,Neutral,0
been kind of anemic uh you go into the,0.6,Positive,1
app store and it's the same couple dozen,0.0,Neutral,0
applications that are highlighted kind,0.6,Positive,1
of reminds me the early days of you know,0.1,Positive,1
amazon prime video where you couldn't,0.0,Neutral,0
even search for vide because their,0.0,Neutral,0
library wasn't that deep and so it's,0.0,Neutral,0
like here's a couple dozen of the great,0.8,Positive,1
things you can do don't dive too deep,0.0,Neutral,0
otherwise it's trails off pretty quickly,0.29166666666666663,Positive,1
into some basic basic applications and i,0.0,Neutral,0
i feel that with vision pro there are a,0.0,Neutral,0
couple really fun and great things and,0.55,Positive,1
then there are a bunch of like task apps,0.0,Neutral,0
and timer apps and clock applications,0.0,Neutral,0
that are just kind of filler it feels,0.6,Positive,1
like the selection of ipad applications,0.0,Neutral,0
ipad and iphone uh iphone o os uh,0.0,Neutral,0
compatible apps is well over a million,0.0,Neutral,0
and i do love having them in the near,0.3,Positive,1
field using the direct input to,0.1,Positive,1
interface with but that's not the true,0.35,Positive,1
potential of spatial computing and even,0.0,Neutral,0
then there don't seem to be a way to,0.0,Neutral,0
surface the best version of those uh,1.0,Positive,1
that work with uh vision os you're just,0.0,Neutral,0
kind of searching based on what you may,0.6,Positive,1
remember that you have on the ipad or,0.0,Neutral,0
the iphone and then the system while it,0.0,Neutral,0
is extremely responsive and the,-0.125,Negative,0
performance has been incredibly,0.9,Positive,1
impressive it's been a little bit of,0.40625,Positive,1
buggy i mean it's it reminds me of the,-0.3125,Negative,0
early days of the ipad where uh as,0.1,Positive,1
stable as an osa that was at launch,0.0,Neutral,0
you'd have to manually swipe away the,0.0,Neutral,0
applications and here i'm forc quitting,0.0,Neutral,0
from time to time or sometimes things,0.0,Neutral,0
won't load and i'm actually having to,0.0,Neutral,0
disconnect the power and shut off and,0.0,Neutral,0
reboot the whole headset and only one,0.1,Positive,1
time have i had the headset go dark on,-0.15,Negative,0
me uh through a bug and had the manly,0.0,Neutral,0
reset and it's pretty jarring i mean if,-0.03125,Negative,0
an application crashes that's fine i can,0.4166666666666667,Positive,1
reboot it uh i can restart it if i know,0.0,Neutral,0
i'm restarting the headset and take it,0.0,Neutral,0
off but when the screens go black,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
suddenly uh that's when i really feel,0.1,Positive,1
like like wow i forgot i'm wearing a,0.1,Positive,1
headset and this is it being all black,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
not a great feeling let me take this off,-0.4,Negative,0
reset it and put it back on uh so,0.0,Neutral,0
definitely could be a little more stable,0.10416666666666667,Positive,1
uh in the versions going forward but,0.0,Neutral,0
what the headset has been great at media,0.8,Positive,1
viewing first and foremost as great as,0.525,Positive,1
the ipad has been for viewing photos and,0.0,Neutral,0
watching movies this is the next level,0.0,Neutral,0
up we wondered forever you know if apple,0.0,Neutral,0
was going to make a physical tv turns,0.0,Neutral,0
out they don't need to a headset with a,0.0,Neutral,0
virtual tv with a virtual cinema screen,0.0,Neutral,0
is the solution for that and paired with,0.0,Neutral,0
what they've built into apple tv and,0.0,Neutral,0
apple tv plus and all their partner uh,0.0,Neutral,0
applications for streaming and local,0.0,Neutral,0
playback and viewing youtube um this is,0.0,Neutral,0
been just a joy to watch 4k video in and,0.8,Positive,1
honestly also to view photos in i'm,0.6,Positive,1
always amazed in the photos application,0.0,Neutral,0
how good an an iphone photo looks in,0.7,Positive,1
headset being able to swipe through you,0.5,Positive,1
know all the thousands and thousands of,0.0,Neutral,0
photos i've taken with iphones and,0.0,Neutral,0
smartphones over the years they've also,0.0,Neutral,0
done an impeccable almost perfect job at,0.875,Positive,1
their slam tracking uh with a foundation,0.0,Neutral,0
for mixed reality the responsiveness of,0.0,Neutral,0
the pass through especially in the near,0.05,Positive,1
field and with the hand occlusion plus,0.0,Neutral,0
the fact that windows just stay in place,0.0,Neutral,0
i've never had a virtual window drift,0.0,Neutral,0
off or not be pixel precise to exactly,0.325,Positive,1
where it was if i walked to another part,0.0,Neutral,0
of the house and walk back to it that is,0.0,Neutral,0
something they've just solved and that,0.0,Neutral,0
no other tracking system headset system,0.0625,Positive,1
has done so far and even though there's,0.1,Positive,1
more that i wish they were doing with,0.5,Positive,1
that slam tracking and making,0.0,Neutral,0
applications more reactive and more,0.5,Positive,1
semantically aware of the kind of the,0.425,Positive,1
geography of the rooms you're in they've,0.0,Neutral,0
done that uh incredibly with audio so,0.9,Positive,1
the spatial audio not only having the,0.0,Neutral,0
sound come from where the windows are,0.4,Positive,1
floating from but bouncing from either,0.0,Neutral,0
an immersive environment or the real,0.2,Positive,1
physical envir whether you're in a small,-0.125,Negative,0
room a large room a room with hardwood,0.21428571428571427,Positive,1
floors or a room with what they,0.0,Neutral,0
recognize as carpeted floors all those,0.0,Neutral,0
soundscapes feel believable it's one of,0.5,Positive,1
those things where going back from this,0.0,Neutral,0
headset to a previous you know to a,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
quest you notice that while there is,0.0,Neutral,0
positional audio in in the quest the,0.0,Neutral,0
sound the spatial audio just doesn't,0.4,Positive,1
feel as realistic or believable um until,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
you've tried it in apple vision pro and,0.0,Neutral,0
then the final thing that feels like a,0.0,Neutral,0
killer application and i've had such a,0.0,Neutral,0
pleasure of using this in is travel the,0.0,Neutral,0
travel mode so i've been lucky enough to,0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
take couple flights with this already,0.0,Neutral,0
taking on a work trip uh didn't even,0.0,Neutral,0
bring a laptop on those work trips and,0.0,Neutral,0
on the plane enabling travel mode which,0.0,Neutral,0
does take you know a little bit of,-0.1875,Negative,0
navigating if you're already in the air,0.0,Neutral,0
and you want to activate it from the uh,0.0,Neutral,0
the the control menu um once you've,0.0,Neutral,0
toggled it on uh it is solid enough that,0.0,Neutral,0
i could enjoy an incredible screen and,0.65,Positive,1
it's so it's so it kind of opens,0.6,Positive,1
mentally the amount of space i have so,-0.1,Negative,0
sitting in an economy seat and normally,0.15,Positive,1
feeling very physically constrained just,0.0,Neutral,0
the act of having a photo album you know,0.0,Neutral,0
a little further out and a media player,-0.09375,Negative,0
a little further out and and then you,-0.09375,Negative,0
know a podcast application into the seat,0.0,Neutral,0
next to me makes me feel more at ease i,0.25,Positive,1
my my mind feels like i'm less,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
constricted and it's less claustrophobic,-0.4583333333333333,Negative,0
uh and i'm less looking at the pass,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
through of the world around me and,0.0,Neutral,0
looking at the depth the z depth of,0.0,Neutral,0
these virtual windows and it really made,0.2,Positive,1
flying on a whether it was a short,0.0,Neutral,0
flight or long flight feel like one the,-0.05,Negative,0
time went by much faster uh and i just,0.2,Positive,1
felt less claustrophobic overall even,-0.3055555555555555,Negative,0
though i was in my own heads space uh,0.6,Positive,1
wearing a headset and then using in a,0.0,Neutral,0
hotel room not having to look at a small,-0.25,Negative,0
ipad screen or laptop screen and having,0.0,Neutral,0
a full web browser word processor email,0.35,Positive,1
application up filling the space in,0.0,Neutral,0
front of me uh that was been great for,0.8,Positive,1
being productive while on the road one,0.0,Neutral,0
thing i can't get enough of in apple,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro is just the experience of,0.0,Neutral,0
viewing 3d models of manipulating a a,0.0,Neutral,0
usdz model that you can pull from an,0.0,Neutral,0
online repository you can email to,0.0,Neutral,0
yourself you can download and having it,0.0,Neutral,0
float in your space the crispness of the,0.0,Neutral,0
panels and the models rendered at native,0.0,Neutral,0
scale it feels it feel i hesitate to use,0.0,Neutral,0
the word magical but it feels like this,0.5,Positive,1
magical moment in interacting with 3d,0.5,Positive,1
objects uh apps like polycam and,0.0,Neutral,0
jigspace really show the potential of,0.1,Positive,1
what it can what interacting and what,0.0,Neutral,0
interfacing with three-dimensional data,0.0,Neutral,0
and three-dimensional visualizations can,0.0,Neutral,0
mean in a mixed reality headset just,-0.15625,Negative,0
because of the sheer performance and,0.0,Neutral,0
resolution and clarity of that and it,0.0,Neutral,0
benefits from all the things that,0.0,Neutral,0
apple's been doing with ar kit i mean,-0.3125,Negative,0
not only do the flat plane windows with,-0.0125,Negative,0
the frosted glass react to lighting in,0.0,Neutral,0
your room uh but also the 3d models,0.0,Neutral,0
actually in semi-real time react to the,0.0,Neutral,0
lighting and actual details the texture,0.0,Neutral,0
in your room as well something you can,0.0,Neutral,0
do is pull up a highly reflective object,0.16,Positive,1
like a the the front dome of a an,0.0,Neutral,0
astronaut's helmet or an iron man armor,0.0,Neutral,0
and as you maybe change the lights in,0.0,Neutral,0
your room or have it move around your,0.0,Neutral,0
workspace the reflections in that shiny,0.0,Neutral,0
surface are actually being baked into,0.0,Neutral,0
the flection maps on the 3d model itself,0.0,Neutral,0
it feels more believable not just,0.5,Positive,1
because of how fixated it is in your,0.0,Neutral,0
virtual space in that z space in the,0.0,Neutral,0
pass through but the fact that it's,0.0,Neutral,0
reacting to the information that's,0.0,Neutral,0
passed through the cameras as well into,0.0,Neutral,0
the object this is something that,0.0,Neutral,0
apple's done really really well and it's,0.2,Positive,1
made it such a joy to bring those,0.4,Positive,1
objects into the shared space now a,0.0,Neutral,0
couple of anecdotes i want to talk about,0.0,Neutral,0
and one is augmented reality tracking,0.0,Neutral,0
and i mentioned a few times a few places,-0.2,Negative,0
is where the system can recognize real,0.2,Positive,1
physical objects thing we've been asking,0.0,Neutral,0
hardware vr hardware makers whether it,0.0,Neutral,0
can do and you know the quest has a way,0.0,Neutral,0
of representing or recognizing the,0.0,Neutral,0
limited number of keyboards and,-0.07142857142857142,Negative,0
implementing a a digital overlay on that,0.0,Neutral,0
uh here it recognizes the apple magic,0.5,Positive,1
keyboard uh a macbook actually the,0.0,Neutral,0
macbook keyboard not the screen part of,0.0,Neutral,0
it to have those floating uh images and,0.0,Neutral,0
some think it's interesting about that,0.5,Positive,1
is the the responsiveness and latency of,0.0,Neutral,0
that seems to be updating that uh that,0.0,Neutral,0
model about one frame a second and so,0.0,Neutral,0
all the kind of dreams of it being of,0.6,Positive,1
being able to recognize your phone and,0.5,Positive,1
kind of do a hologram above your phone,0.3,Positive,1
or a hologram above your watch seems to,0.0,Neutral,0
be far-fetched because it's not tapping,0.0,Neutral,0
into the full ar kit's ability to do a,0.35,Positive,1
60 hertz update on its computer vision,0.0,Neutral,0
tracking of physical objects without,0.0,Neutral,0
tracking markers because there are no,0.0,Neutral,0
tracking markers on the magic keyboard,0.5,Positive,1
or the macbooks and so maybe it's,0.0,Neutral,0
something they can train the system to,0.0,Neutral,0
tap into and unlock in the future but i,0.0,Neutral,0
say don't expect that kind of floating,0.6,Positive,1
hologram track to your wrist anytime,0.0,Neutral,0
soon uh also want to mention the apple,0.0,Neutral,0
store experience i went to go and get my,0.0,Neutral,0
light seal fitted and the apple store,0.4,Positive,1
experience is fascinating it's something,0.7,Positive,1
that only they can do apple because they,0.0,Neutral,0
have the stores when you buy the headset,0.0,Neutral,0
you might have you know you might have,0.0,Neutral,0
bought it to be delivered in the store,0.0,Neutral,0
what's actually delivered to apple isn't,0.0,Neutral,0
a closed box um because when you go in,-0.1,Negative,0
you still have to go through a light,0.4,Positive,1
seal fitting to make sure that what you,0.5,Positive,1
were scann is best suited for you and,1.0,Positive,1
full credit and kudos to apple store,0.35,Positive,1
employees for the amount of patience,0.0,Neutral,0
i've seen them um give to new headset,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
users or are the first time in headset,0.25,Positive,1
or even people who are very experienced,1.0,Positive,1
in headsets like me who've gone in who,0.0,Neutral,0
just want you know to get a different,0.0,Neutral,0
light seal or try different light seals,0.26666666666666666,Positive,1
on uh they were fully able to accompany,0.5,Positive,1
uh prescription lenses by just putting,0.0,Neutral,0
my glasses inside a way to measure my,0.0,Neutral,0
prescription all of that is very private,0.0,Neutral,0
so they don't even know what my,0.0,Neutral,0
prescription is and then someone in the,0.0,Neutral,0
back gets uh a notification for what you,0.0,Neutral,0
know what what lens is to pull out of a,0.0,Neutral,0
drawer to to then give uh for the demo,0.0,Neutral,0
and the headsets they're actually from,0.0,Neutral,0
what i understand assembled the,0.0,Neutral,0
packaging is assembled in store and so,0.0,Neutral,0
even if you've ordered you know a,0.0,Neutral,0
headset with a 23w light seal you know,0.4,Positive,1
in the back they actually pull the,0.0,Neutral,0
headset put it in the box pick the right,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
light seal put it merit to the box get,0.4,Positive,1
the right size of knit band attach it,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
and then someone in blue gloves plastic,0.0,Neutral,0
gloves is putting it package all,0.0,Neutral,0
together and then taping it up um to,0.0,Neutral,0
then give you a sealed box that you take,0.0,Neutral,0
home it's not something that's sealed,0.0,Neutral,0
overseas and then shipped to the store,0.0,Neutral,0
so it's a very custom retail experience,0.2,Positive,1
that i don't see them doing it best buy,1.0,Positive,1
for example this is one of the reasons i,0.0,Neutral,0
don't see you know prepackaged apple,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pros in big box stores that apple,0.0,Neutral,0
would otherwise sell ipads and iphones,0.0,Neutral,0
at uh you would have to buy this either,0.0,Neutral,0
directly shipped directly to you or to,0.1,Positive,1
an apple store where they will package,0.0,Neutral,0
it up behind the scenes,-0.4,Negative,0
very interesting the way they're doing,0.65,Positive,1
that um also that the battery you know,0.0,Neutral,0
we talked about battery life a little,-0.1875,Negative,0
bit at 2 and 1 half hours and the fact,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
that it is removable it makes this the,0.0,Neutral,0
first apple product in well over a,0.25,Positive,1
decade that has kind of a user,0.6,Positive,1
replaceable battery now it's not cheap,-0.2,Negative,0
it's 200 bucks to to buy a new battery,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
and this is a solia battery there's no,0.0,Neutral,0
battery in the headset but as people,0.0,Neutral,0
pointed out you can detach this,0.0,Neutral,0
connector with a metal pin it's a,0.0,Neutral,0
variant of their lightning connection,0.0,Neutral,0
same with the side straps here and the,0.0,Neutral,0
headset battery while it disconnects you,0.0,Neutral,0
can see there are uh six contacts on the,0.0,Neutral,0
inside here and i'm curious it's neither,-0.1,Negative,0
hasn't been confirmed to me either way,0.4,Positive,1
of whether that would allow any type of,0.0,Neutral,0
data transfer through this six pin,0.0,Neutral,0
proprietary connection in the future,0.0,Neutral,0
because right now there is no way of,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
onboarding data directly onto a headset,0.1,Positive,1
unless you buy a special developer s,0.35714285714285715,Positive,1
strap with a usb connection but i would,0.0,Neutral,0
love it in the future for there to be,0.25,Positive,1
for a a standard user a way to have a,0.0,Neutral,0
battery with data pass through um and,0.0,Neutral,0
hopefully that's not physically,0.0,Neutral,0
impossible given this six pin,-0.6666666666666666,Negative,0
arrangement inside here the unit starts,0.0,Neutral,0
at 256 gigs and i think that that is is,0.0,Neutral,0
sufficient for the vast majority of,0.0,Neutral,0
users movie sizes uh to vary in size so,0.0,Neutral,0
a standard 4k movie is somewhere in,0.0,Neutral,0
about the four to 6 gigabyte range it's,0.0,Neutral,0
interesting that the same movie,0.25,Positive,1
downloaded in apple tv and disney plus,0.0,Neutral,0
will actually be different sizes and,0.0,Neutral,0
notice you know moana for example both,0.0,Neutral,0
3d movies one was 8 gigs and one was six,0.0,Neutral,0
gigs and then the largest movie i saw,0.0,Neutral,0
was avatar way of water that's high,0.16,Positive,1
frame rate in stereo,0.0,Neutral,0
3d and i was about 20 gigs and so if,0.0,Neutral,0
you're going to be caching movies on the,0.0,Neutral,0
go 256 gigs seems plenty uh and you can,0.0,Neutral,0
also toggle in the settings for it to,0.0,Neutral,0
autom manage like on your phone your,0.0,Neutral,0
photos applications and icloud so while,0.0,Neutral,0
the headset will be back up the icloud,0.0,Neutral,0
it doesn't need to sync up your entirety,0.0,Neutral,0
of your icloud catalog onto the headset,0.0,Neutral,0
um if you want to spend the extra 200,0.0,Neutral,0
for 512 gigs that seems to also be a,0.0,Neutral,0
nice sweet spot if you're if you're,0.475,Positive,1
planning on using this as a primary,0.4,Positive,1
computing device and then something to,0.0,Neutral,0
also keep an eye on even though there,0.0,Neutral,0
are applications that let you do remote,-0.1,Negative,0
desktop from a windows pc getting,0.0,Neutral,0
something like steam vr or pc vr stream,0.0,Neutral,0
to headset is still in the early days it,0.1,Positive,1
has been possible with thirdparty,0.0,Neutral,0
tinkering but it would require uh,0.0,Neutral,0
aligning track controllers like steamvr,0.0,Neutral,0
controllers uh with the headset and,0.0,Neutral,0
disabling the hand pass through um for,0.0,Neutral,0
full immersive uh comfort uh and it's,0.35,Positive,1
just not something readily available yet,0.4,Positive,1
although technologically it is possible,0.0,Neutral,0
something we're going to keep an eye on,0.0,Neutral,0
so as i wrap up my review of apple,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro i do want to talk about this,0.0,Neutral,0
as a product that you can buy today its,0.0,Neutral,0
value as a piece of technology you can,0.0,Neutral,0
buy today as well as what what might say,0.0,Neutral,0
about headsets virtual reality mixed,0.0,Neutral,0
reality augmented reality headsets going,0.0,Neutral,0
forward and let's be up front this is,0.0,Neutral,0
the most,0.5,Positive,1
expensive piece of technology the most,0.0,Neutral,0
expensive computer i have at home right,-0.10714285714285715,Negative,0
now more expensive than my laptop my,0.0,Neutral,0
gaming pc my meta quest 3 my game,-0.4,Negative,0
console my phone my ipad almost combined,0.0,Neutral,0
right with what you can buy for 3 500,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
"to 4,000 you could buy the latest",0.5,Positive,1
iphone a macbook pro game console and,-0.4,Negative,0
the meta quest 3 and so from a pure,0.21428571428571427,Positive,1
dollars to utility value proposition,0.0,Neutral,0
it's not for anyone who's looking to buy,0.0,Neutral,0
a new computing device to replace those,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
other devices it is at once a developer,-0.125,Negative,0
kit as well as an early adopter device,0.1,Positive,1
to tap into the latest that's out there,0.5,Positive,1
and as a piece of technology it is,0.0,Neutral,0
undoubtedly,0.0,Neutral,0
the most impressive and advanced single,0.45714285714285713,Positive,1
piece of technology i've ever owned i,0.0,Neutral,0
mean having used every single almost,-0.1919642857142857,Negative,0
every single vr headset previously,-0.11904761904761904,Negative,0
having used everything from 3d printers,0.0,Neutral,0
to drones to you know high-end home,0.0,Neutral,0
entertainment systems um the apple,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro feels more like a piece of,0.5,Positive,1
the future available today and that,0.2,Positive,1
alone for those of you out there who are,0.0,Neutral,0
curious about this technology or who are,-0.1,Negative,0
into a virtual reality into mixed,0.0,Neutral,0
reality into technology in general and,0.05000000000000002,Positive,1
have the discretionary funds to to pay,0.0,Neutral,0
for it um that might be worth it in its,0.3,Positive,1
own it also is very clearly the,0.365,Positive,1
foundation for this spatial computing,0.0,Neutral,0
platform and this new era of computing,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
that apple is going to develop alongside,0.0,Neutral,0
what's going to be around for a long,-0.05,Negative,0
time phones mac os flat screen,-0.025,Negative,0
interfaces and you can very clearly see,0.13000000000000003,Positive,1
see that because of how much flat screen,-0.025,Negative,0
interfaces feel like a part of vision os,0.0,Neutral,0
today those aren't going to be replaced,0.0,Neutral,0
feels very complimentary um and the the,0.39,Positive,1
foundational technologies they've built,0.0,Neutral,0
in here from personas to pass through to,0.0,Neutral,0
the slam tracking the the the lock,0.0,Neutral,0
spatial anchors for uh for windows um,0.0,Neutral,0
the interface of gaze and tap all those,0.0,Neutral,0
fuel foundational not just for vision,0.0,Neutral,0
pro as a product line going forward but,0.0,Neutral,0
for this headset uh in its next couple,0.0,Neutral,0
years of life um you know can't imagine,0.0,Neutral,0
them releasing another vision headset in,0.0,Neutral,0
the next 18 months or so and it feels,0.0,Neutral,0
like there's still so much untapped uh,0.2,Positive,1
potential in this headset they're,0.0,Neutral,0
waiting for developers and apple to,0.0,Neutral,0
explore develop and release in the,0.0,Neutral,0
coming years,0.0,Neutral,0
and whether or not the price of that,0.0,Neutral,0
becomes more affordable or the headset,0.5,Positive,1
future versions of it gets lighter,0.0,Neutral,0
what's exciting for me as someone who's,0.3,Positive,1
just fascinated by technology and loves,0.0,Neutral,0
this stuff is how exciting it is this,0.3,Positive,1
this first month has been adam also has,0.25,Positive,1
an apple vision pro and he's love using,0.5,Positive,1
it and we are chatting almost every day,0.0,Neutral,0
talking about the new things we're,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
discovering in the headset the new,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
things we're trying out and the things,0.0,Neutral,0
were 3d printing to to modify it and and,0.0,Neutral,0
the ways were the new new new types of,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
apps and experiences and it feels so,0.0,Neutral,0
much like those first couple weeks and,0.225,Positive,1
months of when the iphone came out and,0.0,Neutral,0
we're all learning new things with that,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
fundamentally new way,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
of enjoying media of computing of,0.5,Positive,1
browsing the internet and of,0.0,Neutral,0
communicating um you know like steve job,0.0,Neutral,0
says internet communicator a phone and a,0.0,Neutral,0
an ipod with video all of that again,0.0,Neutral,0
feels new and fresh here and that's what,0.21818181818181817,Positive,1
a lot of us are buying into is to be on,0.0,Neutral,0
the ground floor um and and to be in,0.0,Neutral,0
that discussion and to learn these,0.0,Neutral,0
things and to feel like we're being a,0.0,Neutral,0
part of the future as it's unfolding in,0.0,Neutral,0
front of us now what this device means,0.0,Neutral,0
for headsets going forward though you,0.0,Neutral,0
know i've seen a lot of discussion about,0.0,Neutral,0
this is fundamentally still an,0.0,Neutral,0
intermediate device to what apple may,0.0,Neutral,0
want or what any company may want going,0.0,Neutral,0
forward which is you know the glasses,0.0,Neutral,0
the wearable augmented reality glasses,0.0,Neutral,0
optical pass through and this debate,0.0,Neutral,0
over you know is optical pass through,0.0,Neutral,0
the end all beall versus a digital pass,0.0,Neutral,0
through system because even as the best,1.0,Positive,1
digital pass through system available to,0.2,Positive,1
consumers today you can clearly see the,0.10000000000000002,Positive,1
limits of it and i can personally still,0.0,Neutral,0
see the ways in which it can improve,0.0,Neutral,0
with known knowable technologies whether,0.0,Neutral,0
it's you know verif focal lenses for,0.0,Neutral,0
more comfortable nearfield viewing or,0.45,Positive,1
you know just higher resolution cameras,0.25,Positive,1
uh more perspective correct you know,0.5,Positive,1
reprojection and rectification of the,0.0,Neutral,0
pastor images like all these things,0.0,Neutral,0
improve hand track hand model tracking,0.0,Neutral,0
all these things you know can be uh,0.0,Neutral,0
things paths going forward that give,0.0,Neutral,0
video pass through mixed reality pass,0.0,Neutral,0
through a uh a path for and it's my,0.0,Neutral,0
personal belief that it's not going to,0.0,Neutral,0
be convergence to a single device you,-0.07142857142857142,Negative,0
know that meta doesn't make the meta the,0.0,Neutral,0
rayband with meta sunglasses and the,0.0,Neutral,0
quest pro as two uh product lines that,0.0,Neutral,0
will eventually become one product but,0.0,Neutral,0
they are kind of going to be two product,0.6,Positive,1
lines that well they may share,0.0,Neutral,0
technologies in terms of world tracking,0.0,Neutral,0
and a user interface uh they're going to,0.0,Neutral,0
be as different as having a watch to a,0.0,Neutral,0
laptop top you know there's going to be,0.5,Positive,1
a device that you're going to wear out,0.0,Neutral,0
in the world like a digital watch like,0.0,Neutral,0
an apple watch that can give you,0.0,Neutral,0
information that can give you glanceable,0.0,Neutral,0
details but is low power uh and blends,0.0,Neutral,0
into your daily wearable you know uh,0.0,Neutral,0
technology um but doesn't have the,0.0,Neutral,0
compute or the battery life as what you,0.0,Neutral,0
would buy a laptop for uh in the same,0.0,Neutral,0
way i think that there's going to be a,0.0,Neutral,0
world where there is a a vision pro or a,0.0,Neutral,0
vision category or device that you're,0.0,Neutral,0
going to use at home in a kind of,0.6,Positive,1
stationary office working environment or,0.0,Neutral,0
on the couch in your living room kind of,0.6,Positive,1
indoors um that has the compute that can,0.0,Neutral,0
use that can tap into you know a larger,0.0,Neutral,0
battery um and then maybe a version of,0.0,Neutral,0
that that is tapping into optical pass,0.0,Neutral,0
through that you would wear out in the,0.0,Neutral,0
world that would give you less,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
information or different type of,0.0,Neutral,0
information but be more about seeing the,0.5,Positive,1
world around you and for the mixed,0.0,Neutral,0
reality experience where the primary,0.4,Positive,1
type of content is the digital content i,0.0,Neutral,0
want to interact with and not the world,0.0,Neutral,0
i need to see interact with i don't need,0.0,Neutral,0
the video pass through to be perfect i,1.0,Positive,1
need to be good enough where it's not,0.35,Positive,1
getting the way of my interaction with,0.0,Neutral,0
the real world with my talking to people,0.2,Positive,1
my picking up of objects and i think,0.0,Neutral,0
this has crested that point already,0.0,Neutral,0
there is a clear path forward for,0.10000000000000002,Positive,1
improvement you know it could be lighter,0.0,Neutral,0
it could be more comfortable the battery,0.45,Positive,1
life could be longer it could have more,0.5,Positive,1
memory or faster processor and it could,0.0,Neutral,0
have better pass through and that makes,0.5,Positive,1
me really excited for future v versions,0.1875,Positive,1
of the vision pro but the fundamentals i,0.0,Neutral,0
think they really got right from the,0.24285714285714285,Positive,1
user interface the minimum benchmark for,0.0,Neutral,0
visual clarity both in the pass through,0.0,Neutral,0
and in the digital content which makes,0.0,Neutral,0
this the best media player that you can,1.0,Positive,1
have today as well as as more than,0.5,Positive,1
serviceable and usable and certainly a,0.21428571428571427,Positive,1
great travel companion those are the two,0.8,Positive,1
reasons to buy a vision pro today media,0.0,Neutral,0
and travel and for everyone else it's,0.0,Neutral,0
just fun being on the ground floor so,0.3,Positive,1
that's it that's a deep dive into apple,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro uh if there are questions or,0.0,Neutral,0
other things that you'd like me to talk,-0.125,Negative,0
about or discuss please post them in the,0.0,Neutral,0
comments below um hope this has been,0.0,Neutral,0
enjoyable and entertaining for you as uh,0.5,Positive,1
this has been a long time coming uh and,-0.05,Negative,0
thank you so much for watching i'm norm,0.2,Positive,1
and i'll see you next time,0.0,Neutral,0
bye,0.0,Neutral,0
siri open,0.0,Neutral,0
messages siri open,0.0,Neutral,0
photos so cool i'll put this over here,0.35,Positive,1
and look up and,0.0,Neutral,0
oh,0.0,Neutral,0
wow,0.1,Positive,1
wow siri take me to,0.1,Positive,1
yos siri close all my,0.0,Neutral,0
apps are you kidding,0.0,Neutral,0
me,0.0,Neutral,0
holy,0.0,Neutral,0
music,0.0,Neutral,0
oh hey there what's up everybody,0.0,Neutral,0
brian tong here and this is is my review,0.0,Neutral,0
of yes the apple vision pro i've had it,0.0,Neutral,0
for about a week been one of the few,-0.2,Negative,0
lucky people to really dive deep and get,0.17777777777777778,Positive,1
into this and you know if there's one,0.0,Neutral,0
word that i could say to explain this,0.0,Neutral,0
like one word it's immersive and we're,0.0,Neutral,0
going to talk all about this because,0.0,Neutral,0
there is truly no other thing out there,0.0625,Positive,1
on planet earth like this this is one of,0.0,Neutral,0
a kind and i'm sure you know everyone,0.55,Positive,1
wants to try to make comparisons but,0.2,Positive,1
this is a whole new approach to the,0.16818181818181818,Positive,1
mixed reality space augmented reality,0.0,Neutral,0
virtual reality mixed reality and this,0.0,Neutral,0
review is going to happen over multiple,0.0,Neutral,0
days because there's just so much to,0.2,Positive,1
show you and experience and the apple,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro this is just different from,0.0,Neutral,0
the moment you look at it the hardware,0.0,Neutral,0
the elegance the quality materials like,0.0,Neutral,0
you can check out my unboxing for a real,0.2,Positive,1
up close look at it and just even how to,0.0,Neutral,0
properly fit either this solon nit band,0.4,Positive,1
or the dual loop band i show it to you,0.0,Neutral,0
all but for me in this review i want to,0.0,Neutral,0
bring as much of the experience to you,0.2,Positive,1
as possible right i want you to see what,0.14285714285714285,Positive,1
makes it special what makes this,0.35714285714285715,Positive,1
different and obviously look i'm going,0.0,Neutral,0
to say it right at the top go check this,0.39285714285714285,Positive,1
out at an apple store for yourself for,0.0,Neutral,0
those of you that pre-ordered it on day,0.0,Neutral,0
one hey that's you but that's not,0.0,Neutral,0
everybody most people are still,0.5,Positive,1
considering is this something that i,0.0,Neutral,0
"really want to invest in 3,499 starting",0.1,Positive,1
so uh that's that's what we're going to,0.0,Neutral,0
hope to answer now enough of that talk,0.0,Neutral,0
right let's talk about setup setup,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
starts with a eye measurement then you,0.0,Neutral,0
do a hand scan your palms put your palms,0.0,Neutral,0
out and then there's three different,0.0,Neutral,0
calibrations for tracking your pupil,0.0,Neutral,0
because of dilation so it's done in,0.0,Neutral,0
different lighting it's this fun little,0.0375,Positive,1
pattern of dots that you tap with your,0.0,Neutral,0
finger this is kind of like the,0.6,Positive,1
universal sign for apple vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
right um because look this is what,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
you're going to use you don't have to,0.0,Neutral,0
have you don't need controllers except,0.0,Neutral,0
you know if you want to do some certain,0.21428571428571427,Positive,1
games but it's your eyes and your hands,0.0,Neutral,0
um and these are your primary tools so,0.4,Positive,1
let's show you how to use them all,0.0,Neutral,0
together now we already did the setup,0.0,Neutral,0
all the calibration and obviously ey,0.0,Neutral,0
tracking is a big part of this so let's,0.0,Neutral,0
go to the home screen i'm just going to,0.0,Neutral,0
click the digital crown here and i can,0.0,Neutral,0
what you'll see is right now what i'm,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
staring at is what will be in focus for,0.0,Neutral,0
you but i'm staring at the icons here,0.0,Neutral,0
and that's just using my eye you see,0.0,Neutral,0
them kind of come forward all right,0.44285714285714284,Positive,1
because everything i do is with my eyes,0.0,Neutral,0
if i want to select something let's go,0.0,Neutral,0
to somewhere like messages let's just do,0.0,Neutral,0
a pinch a single tap it opens up the app,-0.07142857142857142,Negative,0
look everywhere where i look you're,0.0,Neutral,0
seeing it get highlighted the ey,0.0,Neutral,0
tracking is,0.0,Neutral,0
incredibly accurate and so when you,0.4000000000000001,Positive,1
first use this you you'll be flying all,0.25,Positive,1
over the place but it's amazing okay so,0.55,Positive,1
we have the single tap i can close this,-0.07142857142857142,Negative,0
or if i want to show you something else,0.0,Neutral,0
let's do a pinch and hold and on that,0.0,Neutral,0
bottom bar here that allows me to,0.0,Neutral,0
manipulate this window however i want,0.0,Neutral,0
bring it close push it out far i can,0.1,Positive,1
even look on the on the right hand,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
corner to expand the size of this this,0.0,Neutral,0
is like scaling it right bring it out,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
smaller depending on where it is so,0.0,Neutral,0
there's difference between positioning,0.0,Neutral,0
it closer to you or further away from,0.0,Neutral,0
you and then also if you want to do,0.0,Neutral,0
something like pinch and drag look i can,-0.1,Negative,0
scroll up and down here by pinching and,-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
dragging holding it and going up and,0.0,Neutral,0
down that's pretty neat let's go to,0.04722222222222221,Positive,1
somewhere like um our photos okay i'm,0.5,Positive,1
going to select,0.0,Neutral,0
this here's our photos again pinch and,0.0,Neutral,0
drag hold it in spot right to move it up,0.09285714285714285,Positive,1
again i can move this window around um,0.0,Neutral,0
let's go into a specific photo,0.0,Neutral,0
here and this is a fun one and also,0.3,Positive,1
similar to like multi-touch in your on,0.0,Neutral,0
your phone i have this photo here let's,0.0,Neutral,0
take two hands now and i can scale,0.0,Neutral,0
increase the size to zoom right pinch to,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
zoom pinch to shrink it in within the,0.0,Neutral,0
space of the window here all right and,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
then i can s single hold and move this,-0.07142857142857142,Negative,0
around wherever i want,0.0,Neutral,0
oh this is so so freaking cool and then,0.35,Positive,1
i just tapped it to kind of get back to,0.3,Positive,1
the regular size but then let's also,0.0,Neutral,0
show you s other gesture here i'm going,-0.125,Negative,0
to go to let's do a pinch and drag to,-0.1,Negative,0
scroll through this right one move and,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
there's an app called jig,0.0,Neutral,0
space and it brings in 3d objects into,0.0,Neutral,0
environment so i'm going to go to this,0.0,Neutral,0
alpha,0.0,Neutral,0
romeo and it's going to load it in a,0.0,Neutral,0
moment but i'm going to show you some,0.0,Neutral,0
other cool things that you'll be able to,0.24166666666666667,Positive,1
do all right tap to place your jig this,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
is a 3d render model but think of this,0.0,Neutral,0
i'm going to i'm going to rotate and,0.0,Neutral,0
manipulate this space as well so i'm,0.0,Neutral,0
going to take my two fingers pinch,0.0,Neutral,0
together and look now with this app and,0.0,Neutral,0
this specific gesture i'm rotating the,0.0,Neutral,0
alpa romeo i can also scale it and bring,0.0,Neutral,0
it up really big right i can push it in,0.14285714285714285,Positive,1
and tiny this is all done real time um i,0.1,Positive,1
can even get closeup and i think i can,0.0,Neutral,0
look at get parts and pinch pinch off,0.0,Neutral,0
the tire here all right i can basically,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
break this car down and pull it apart oh,-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
this tire is really big here can you get,0.0,Neutral,0
out my way okay thanks buddy but this is,0.35,Positive,1
again some of the magic ways of using,0.5,Positive,1
the gestur from tapping a single tap,-0.07142857142857142,Negative,0
pinching a hold manipulating rotating,0.0,Neutral,0
zooming hold up i almost forgot there's,0.0,Neutral,0
so much stuff here that sometimes i do,0.2,Positive,1
forget things so let's just go to my,0.0,Neutral,0
mail real quick and i talked about a,0.5,Positive,1
press to drag but for content let's say,-0.1,Negative,0
you want to share things hold and,0.0,Neutral,0
typically contextual menu will pop up,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
and it gives me options like open link,0.0,Neutral,0
add a reading list copy link i could,0.0,Neutral,0
share this click on that and then here i,0.0,Neutral,0
can share it to friends airdrop message,0.0,Neutral,0
mail however i want there's just so many,0.5,Positive,1
things that you can do here app,0.0,Neutral,0
developers can make their own ones,0.6,Positive,1
specific to their app so when i say,0.0,Neutral,0
multiple times here we're just,0.0,Neutral,0
scratching the surface we are scratching,0.0,Neutral,0
the surface but so many really cool,0.425,Positive,1
things that you can do here with vision,0.0,Neutral,0
os and uh yeah we just get started it,0.0,Neutral,0
just feels so natural and you're going,0.1,Positive,1
to pick up using the os right away so i,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
think the big thing about the ey,0.0,Neutral,0
tracking is we've seen it on something,0.0,Neutral,0
like the psvr2 but it was only used in,0.0,Neutral,0
maybe a few functions of games but it,-0.2,Negative,0
tracking here with um apple vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
and the vision os is used the entire,0.0,Neutral,0
time to navigate it using hand gestures,0.0,Neutral,0
are being used the entire time so it you,0.0,Neutral,0
don't hold anything it just really right,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
away just feels second nature i will say,0.0,Neutral,0
that you know because when you jump into,0.0,Neutral,0
this for the very first time you're,0.325,Positive,1
going to be juiced up you're going to be,0.0,Neutral,0
amped up just because of the fidelity,0.0,Neutral,0
that you see you've never seen anything,0.0,Neutral,0
like this in a consumer device and i,0.0,Neutral,0
found myself just my eyes fluttering all,0.0,Neutral,0
over the place looking everywhere and so,0.0,Neutral,0
you almost have to like settle yourself,0.0,Neutral,0
down when you get inside here but you,-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
know in the very beginning of this video,0.2,Positive,1
video i showed you multiple apps um you,0.0,Neutral,0
can literally surround yourself you can,0.0,Neutral,0
put different apps in different rooms of,0.0,Neutral,0
your house and then they'll stay in that,0.0,Neutral,0
place then when you walk over that area,0.0,Neutral,0
you'll be able to navigate with them uh,0.5,Positive,1
you can do a lot of that but look let's,0.0,Neutral,0
just get into the first experience and,0.25,Positive,1
that's starting off with spatial,0.0,Neutral,0
computing you know we're going to do a,0.0,Neutral,0
little showand tell here because this is,-0.1875,Negative,0
all about experiences i'm so excited for,0.375,Positive,1
you because look this is the first time,0.25,Positive,1
that we're going to be able to see this,0.5,Positive,1
in act,0.0,Neutral,0
so i have vision pro on obviously look,0.0,Neutral,0
over here i have my m1 max macbook pro,0.0,Neutral,0
this is my workhorse and i'm using adobe,0.0,Neutral,0
premiere so you see the option to,0.0,Neutral,0
connect to it so i say let's connect,0.0,Neutral,0
right i'm going to select that and it's,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
literally just going to take a few,-0.2,Negative,0
moments,0.0,Neutral,0
and voila we have a,0.0,Neutral,0
4k display mac os in front of me now,0.0,Neutral,0
integrated into vision os i can take,0.0,Neutral,0
right just like you'd expect,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
this app and i can move around it went,0.0,Neutral,0
to the screen saver so let me get back,0.0,Neutral,0
here all right i can move this around,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
wherever i want in space i can bring it,0.0,Neutral,0
up here let's just put it right here in,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
this nice sweet spot for me right my,0.41190476190476194,Positive,1
trackpad on my mac is obviously what i'm,0.0,Neutral,0
to use to control mac tab this is my,0.0,Neutral,0
desktop right just in a large screen so,0.25,Positive,1
i can scroll through video here i can,0.0,Neutral,0
play let's do this on the,0.0,Neutral,0
alternative light seal cushion and again,0.4,Positive,1
i can go over here and look at my assets,0.0,Neutral,0
and just drop them in however i want,0.0,Neutral,0
just like i'm i'm just like editing this,0.0,Neutral,0
is real time the latency you don't feel,0.2,Positive,1
it at all so that's pretty cool but,0.3,Positive,1
should we bump things up a notch yes of,0.0,Neutral,0
course we should siri open,0.0,Neutral,0
messages so the vision os app appears i,0.0,Neutral,0
can move it around again however i want,0.0,Neutral,0
let's do another siri open,0.0,Neutral,0
safari oh that's pretty cool maybe we'll,0.3,Positive,1
have to revisit that later but okay i,0.25,Positive,1
have these three apps around me mac os,0.0,Neutral,0
and vision os but here's where it gets,0.0,Neutral,0
saucy i'm going to take my mouse cursor,0.0,Neutral,0
and just pull it over and what do you,0.0,Neutral,0
see here see that little white cursor,-0.09375,Negative,0
what you're familiar with with ipad os,0.375,Positive,1
because that's the foundation of vision,0.0,Neutral,0
os apps i can freely i'm using the,0.4,Positive,1
trackpad on my mac to control this,0.0,Neutral,0
vision os app i'm navigating through it,0.0,Neutral,0
i'm using it like this is freaking wild,0.1,Positive,1
and amazing i can play you know whatever,0.6000000000000001,Positive,1
media content i can scroll up and down,-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
all right let's go back here now you can,0.14285714285714285,Positive,1
see my trackpad on the mac in adobe,0.0,Neutral,0
premiere and let's go over here to,0.0,Neutral,0
safari oh there you go uh should we play,0.0,Neutral,0
a little bit of this what is what's,-0.1875,Negative,0
what's your hair stripe going to look,0.0,Neutral,0
like i it's i mean you it kind of looks,0.14375,Positive,1
blended y all this,0.0,Neutral,0
is mac os vision os two completely,0.1,Positive,1
separate os's working seamlessly in,0.1,Positive,1
spatial computing this is insanee and it,0.0,Neutral,0
works flawlessly right out of the gates,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
uh it is so impressive right this is,0.6428571428571428,Positive,1
again apple's ecosystem coming together,0.0,Neutral,0
and oh i could see myself doing things,0.0,Neutral,0
like instead of bringing a workhorse,0.0,Neutral,0
like this maybe something like an m2,0.0,Neutral,0
macbook air smaller in size portable,0.0,Neutral,0
more light and then with vision pro on a,0.45,Positive,1
plane while i'm traveling pop this open,0.0,Neutral,0
to edit on a huge 4k screen that's a,0.4000000000000001,Positive,1
higher resolution than the m2 macbook,0.25,Positive,1
air this is something that i'm,0.0,Neutral,0
absolutely going to do,0.2,Positive,1
the text rendering is so sharp and clean,0.12083333333333335,Positive,1
um when you're looking inside the,0.0,Neutral,0
headset this is just an amazing,0.6000000000000001,Positive,1
experience and you can even see when i,0.0,Neutral,0
stare at things on here right it still,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
is using vision os and my ey tracking if,0.0,Neutral,0
i want to but you also have the,0.0,Neutral,0
capability to use it either vision os or,0.0,Neutral,0
mac os like,0.0,Neutral,0
that are you not w yet i'm wow and i've,0.1,Positive,1
done this multiple times and there's a,0.0,Neutral,0
lot more to show you now you have native,0.5,Positive,1
apps that are built for vision os you,0.0,Neutral,0
also have compatible apps that are,0.0,Neutral,0
either ios or ipad os that have been,0.0,Neutral,0
turned on um you will find those in a,0.0,Neutral,0
folder on the home screen that's called,0.0,Neutral,0
compatible apps but enough of me talking,0.0,Neutral,0
let's now show you another example of,0.0,Neutral,0
just some of the very very first apps,0.325,Positive,1
that are out there what's up everybody,0.0,Neutral,0
welcome to club btz coming to you from,0.8,Positive,1

could be browsing the web,0.0,Neutral,0
here this is insane this is a sports fan,-1.0,Negative,0
wet dream and it is incredible this is,0.4,Positive,1
again a day one or we're we're at day,0.0,Neutral,0
zero right now launch app for the nba,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
you can only imagine how other sports,-0.0625,Negative,0
leagues will model this then you also,0.0,Neutral,0
think about the future of apple has mls,0.0,Neutral,0
apple has major league baseball apple,0.0625,Positive,1
also has their apple immersive video,0.0,Neutral,0
platform which we know can do sports,0.0,Neutral,0
games so this is just again scratching,0.0,Neutral,0
the surface of what is possible and it,0.0,Neutral,0
is so exciting look if you're an nba fan,0.3,Positive,1
how can you not freak out about it i'm,0.0,Neutral,0
freaking out about this this is,0.0,Neutral,0
incredible are you freaking out yet you,0.9,Positive,1
should be freaking out because this,0.0,Neutral,0
again these is just the fir first day,0.25,Positive,1
one apps that just shows just the just a,0.0,Neutral,0
sliver of the potential of what is,0.0,Neutral,0
possible and your mind just starts going,0.0,Neutral,0
in all these different directions now,0.0,Neutral,0
the biggest thing using vision os the,0.0,Neutral,0
speed of the os running on an m2 i never,0.0,Neutral,0
questioned whether it was too slow,-0.30000000000000004,Negative,0
whether it was laggy where where if if,0.0,Neutral,0
it didn't feel like it was flowing the,0.0,Neutral,0
display here supports 90 hz 96 htz and,0.0,Neutral,0
100 hz refresh rates those different,0.0,Neutral,0
refresh rates um are depending on the,0.0,Neutral,0
type of media content or even overseas,0.0,Neutral,0
in let's say like in europe they have a,0.0,Neutral,0
standard 50 hz so you got to have 100 to,0.0,Neutral,0
kind of match that with the multiplier,0.6,Positive,1
if you're watching something like 24,0.0,Neutral,0
frames per second uh movies that,0.0,Neutral,0
multiplies into 96 seamlessly and then,0.1,Positive,1
30 frames per second uh that multiplies,0.0,Neutral,0
into 90 hz so there's a reason why this,0.0,Neutral,0
display it looks bettery smooth um you,0.4,Positive,1
know some of the screen captures that i,0.0,Neutral,0
have yes i'm screen capturing it so you,0.0,Neutral,0
might be like that doesn't look you know,0.0,Neutral,0
maybe there's a moment or two where,0.0,Neutral,0
might be choppy but trust me like when,-0.2,Negative,0
you have this on uh you you'll never,0.0,Neutral,0
question everyone that said oh why don't,0.0,Neutral,0
they put an m3 in it yes we know like,0.0,Neutral,0
the nextg gpu is in the m3 i i said from,0.0,Neutral,0
day one the m2 has more than enough,0.25,Positive,1
overhead to support this and try this,0.0,Neutral,0
experience it go to store to check it,0.0,Neutral,0
out you will never say oh this feels,0.0,Neutral,0
this feel slow also um we talk about eye,-0.30000000000000004,Negative,0
tracking and hand gestures you're going,0.0,Neutral,0
to be relying on on siri a lot more i,0.5,Positive,1
used it to launch apps to close apps to,0.0,Neutral,0
jump between environments and even,0.0,Neutral,0
because let's be honest uh you can use,0.6,Positive,1
the virtual keyboard um and i've gotten,0.0,Neutral,0
a little more used to it but it's still,0.15625,Positive,1
not ideal ideal when i have to yeah i'll,0.225,Positive,1
deal with it but you know even using,0.0,Neutral,0
your voice to send text messages through,0.0,Neutral,0
siri that's going to um really be one of,0.2,Positive,1
the main ways that you communicate with,0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
it yes you can use a trackpad yes you,0.0,Neutral,0
can use a physical keyboard and they can,0.0,Neutral,0
over bluetooth nicely but you're not,0.6,Positive,1
always going to have those accessible,0.375,Positive,1
next to you um and handy so look you're,0.3,Positive,1
going to rely on your voice your eyes,0.0,Neutral,0
and your hands a lot also if you're,0.0,Neutral,0
talking about okay well how do i make,0.5,Positive,1
payments what if i'm purchasing new apps,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
well you're not using face id because,0.0,Neutral,0
your face is covered but you're using,0.0,Neutral,0
their optic id system which basically,0.0,Neutral,0
does a scan of your eye which is unique,0.375,Positive,1
to each person so that's how they know,0.0,Neutral,0
who you are but also optic id ties into,0.0,Neutral,0
your persona right if you haven't heard,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
about this or seen this the persona this,0.0,Neutral,0
is your digital avatar and you build,0.0,Neutral,0
this directly on the apple vision pro,0.1,Positive,1
now this headset is also for one person,0.0,Neutral,0
but there is a guest user mode so this,0.0,Neutral,0
is you know i talked about optic id this,0.0,Neutral,0
is really truly tied just to one user,0.2,Positive,1
but you can share it you can give them,0.0,Neutral,0
access to the apps that you already had,0.0,Neutral,0
open before you hand it off or you can,0.0,Neutral,0
give them access to all apps on the,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro it's also recommended that a,0.0,Neutral,0
person who wants to try it on as a guest,0.2,Positive,1
gets their own light seal gets their own,0.5333333333333333,Positive,1
uh sizing for vision pro just because,0.0,Neutral,0
that'll give them the optimal fit that,0.4,Positive,1
cost 1.99 but they can get their own,0.6,Positive,1
through apple but this does support,0.0,Neutral,0
guest users so let's set up our persona,0.0,Neutral,0
i'm going to jump in,0.0,Neutral,0
here and go to my,0.0,Neutral,0
settings and then we're going to find,0.0,Neutral,0
persona go there now i have one in here,0.0,Neutral,0
but i want to walk you through the,0.0,Neutral,0
process here so i'm going to go to rec,0.0,Neutral,0
capture and here you go capture how,0.0,Neutral,0
you'll appear in facetime and other,-0.125,Negative,0
calls so let's get,0.0,Neutral,0
started okay refine your handset i'm,0.5,Positive,1
going to put my hands,0.0,Neutral,0
out flip my hands over this is for hand,0.0,Neutral,0
tracking and hand,0.0,Neutral,0
scanning okay to set up your persona,0.5,Positive,1
you'll remove apple the walk this,0.0,Neutral,0
tutorial video which i've done before so,0.0,Neutral,0
i'm just going to say continue take your,0.0,Neutral,0
time getting ready and make sure,0.35,Positive,1
nothing's covering your face,0.0,Neutral,0
to start capturing hold apple vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
continue tips for the best capture find,1.0,Positive,1
a well out area use a symbol background,0.0,Neutral,0
be in front of neutral background,0.0,Neutral,0
hopefully this is good enough okay,0.39999999999999997,Positive,1
remove apple vision pro to begin capture,0.0,Neutral,0
okay let's do this okay okay let's do,0.5,Positive,1
this okay when you're ready hold apple,0.35,Positive,1
vision pro at ey,0.0,Neutral,0
level slowly turn your head to the,-0.30000000000000004,Negative,0
right now slowly turn your head to the,-0.007142857142857173,Negative,0
left,0.0,Neutral,0

now tilt your head,0.0,Neutral,0
up then tilt your head,0.0,Neutral,0
down next let's capture your facial,-0.051851851851851864,Negative,0

process a minute a minute and a,0.0,Neutral,0
half and there i am there that's me oh,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
my gosh hello watch this the mount,0.0,Neutral,0
tracking look look you can choose a,0.0,Neutral,0
natural lighting studio i think is a,0.1,Positive,1
little brighter okay i can go to contour,0.15625,Positive,1
i,0.0,Neutral,0
think it gets a little bit of my stripe,-0.1875,Negative,0
all right gets some of the aspect of it,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
i think with better line my previous one,0.16666666666666669,Positive,1
i it it popped a little more so you you,0.15625,Positive,1
might want to try it a few times but,-0.2,Negative,0
look it also captures your your actual,0.0,Neutral,0
clothes that you did the capture in,0.0,Neutral,0
which is pretty incredible as well but,0.575,Positive,1
look i'm doing my eyes open the my,0.0,Neutral,0
eyebrows i'm doing that this is this is,0.0,Neutral,0
your persona capture this is a beta so,0.0,Neutral,0
because there's so many people um and so,0.5,Positive,1
many different skin tones and sizes and,0.25,Positive,1
shapes apple's making this a beta it is,0.0,Neutral,0
available for everyone that has apple,0.4,Positive,1
vision pro but it'll improve over time,0.0,Neutral,0
but yeah that's pretty impressive you,0.625,Positive,1
can also change the temperature of you,0.0,Neutral,0
know if i'm going if i come back from ha,0.0,Neutral,0
i'm a little tanner that that's more,0.15625,Positive,1
like me um you can play with the,0.0,Neutral,0
brightness as well okay let's keep it in,0.5,Positive,1
the middle but look it scans my hands i,0.0,Neutral,0
can do i can do things with this right,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
it shows me like ah,0.0,Neutral,0

next oh yeah i forgot that i wear if you,0.0,Neutral,0
wear glasses of any kind you can select,0.6,Positive,1
different frames i'm not going to so i'm,0.0,Neutral,0
going to go back here and say none and,0.0,Neutral,0
go to next and there you go that's your,0.0,Neutral,0
persona that you can save so after i got,0.0,Neutral,0
my persona locked in you know what's the,0.0,Neutral,0
first thing that you would do well i,0.25,Positive,1
tried to facetime call with some friends,0.0,Neutral,0
all right so now brian has joined us oh,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1

mar we kind of got a little cone like a,0.20625,Positive,1
little bit of cone head action going up,-0.04375,Negative,0
you know what i'm saying but um i mean,-0.3125,Negative,0
it's better than anyone else has been,0.5,Positive,1
able to do my hair so far so you know,0.3,Positive,1
like there you'll never be able to get,0.5,Positive,1
like a stripe in it so i'm like this,0.0,Neutral,0
cool but the face stuff is kind of wild,0.35000000000000003,Positive,1
i'm just like still the faces are,0.0,Neutral,0
impressive i think right very very it's,0.5152380952380952,Positive,1
it's just at the edge of uncanny valley,0.0,Neutral,0
like i know what you guys look like so i,0.0,Neutral,0

hard as you can to get it looking and it,-0.2916666666666667,Negative,0
never quite looks like you this in what,0.0,Neutral,0
did it take you a minute maybe yeah,0.0,Neutral,0
basically i d i' do a few tries few,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
scans after a few yeah but the hard part,-0.24583333333333335,Negative,0
too is the hair too especially for me,0.0,Neutral,0
cuz it's like you had to have the,0.0,Neutral,0
perfect amount of separation between,1.0,Positive,1
like your face and the ears because it,0.0,Neutral,0
kept like blurring to the side of my,0.0,Neutral,0
face oh that's interesting i feel like i,0.5,Positive,1
can do better but at this point i was,0.5,Positive,1
like we're done we're going to go with,0.0,Neutral,0
this but but like whatever you scan,0.0,Neutral,0
yourself in like that's what you're,0.0,Neutral,0
wearing so it's like my necklace is,0.0,Neutral,0
crooked i like i need to fix that that's,0.0,Neutral,0
so cool part of you now that's part of,0.35,Positive,1
your persona you guys like you said we,0.0,Neutral,0

like this is like a nine out of 10 like,0.0,Neutral,0
of how we actually look it's pretty good,0.31666666666666665,Positive,1
and also like skin tones too cuz we all,0.0,Neutral,0
three of us have very different,0.0,Neutral,0
complexions too and i feel like it,0.0,Neutral,0
actually i think it did a pretty good,0.31666666666666665,Positive,1
job yeah you know what i'm the most,0.5,Positive,1
impressed by the audio right now like,0.6428571428571428,Positive,1

right now is i just put you guys into an,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
environment and it completely changed,0.1,Positive,1
the sound like like so when i go out of,0.4,Positive,1
my my environmental it sounds like,0.0,Neutral,0
you're in room but then it switches to,0.0,Neutral,0
now you're in joshua tree,0.0,Neutral,0
yeah i'm in mountain hood right now yeah,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
it's like the the deadness of no,0.0,Neutral,0
reflections of the wall like and like i,0.0,Neutral,0
can kind of hear like an echo of your,0.6,Positive,1
voice like bouncing off the rocks this,0.0,Neutral,0
is so weird yeah wild jeez man it's it's,-0.2,Negative,0
a lot of like that whole immersion stuff,0.2,Positive,1
the immersion stuff is so crazy like how,-0.6,Negative,0
good it is when it's like the attention,0.7,Positive,1
to detail too like i know we all make,0.0,Neutral,0
fun of apple like oh when apple does,0.3,Positive,1
something like then it's going to be a,0.0,Neutral,0
thing but man they really made this,0.2,Positive,1
super impressive i did not realize that,0.6666666666666666,Positive,1
that yeah when you just said like the,0.0,Neutral,0
audio changed and i tried it i didn't,0.0,Neutral,0
realize how much it made it feel like,0.2,Positive,1
you guys were in the room with me until,0.0,Neutral,0
it changed and now it's like yeah i did,0.0,Neutral,0
mount hood also and it's like now we're,0.0,Neutral,0
out in the wilderness and it sounds like,0.0,Neutral,0
that that's crazy that's so it's just,-0.6,Negative,0
it's so shocking so you can even see,-1.0,Negative,0
during that call if i actually move um,0.0,Neutral,0
the video box you know from on my right,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
side they will actually see kind of a,0.3,Positive,1
side profile on my face if i move it,0.0,Neutral,0
over to my left side they'll see a side,0.0,Neutral,0
profile so there's a little bit of um,-0.1875,Negative,0
spatial awareness but also when you talk,0.0,Neutral,0
about spatial you've got to talk about,0.0,Neutral,0
spatial audio now there are two audio,0.0,Neutral,0
pods here and these are incredible i,0.9,Positive,1
actually yeah i tried using airpods here,0.0,Neutral,0
at home but it sounds so good it,0.7,Positive,1
obviously feels so natural where you,0.05,Positive,1
don't have to have anything over your,0.0,Neutral,0
ears the the spatial audio and just the,0.0,Neutral,0
audio period that is produced in here is,0.0,Neutral,0
incredible depending on where someone's,0.9,Positive,1
located on the screen you feel that,0.0,Neutral,0
directional sound spatial audio whether,0.4,Positive,1
it's movies um but with facetime you,0.0,Neutral,0
know video conferencing and every moment,0.0,Neutral,0
that i've like experienced this it is,0.8,Positive,1
definitely an immersive experience i,0.0,Neutral,0
mean one of the most immersive um and,0.09375,Positive,1
the audio pods they just sound awesome,0.7,Positive,1
another mode that the apple vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
has is travel mode so you can take this,0.0,Neutral,0
on a plane and basically it compensates,0.0,Neutral,0
and calibrates for you being in a moving,0.0,Neutral,0
uh environment or i guess a moving,0.0,Neutral,0
vehicle right now um i believe it,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
supports just airplanes but i'm going to,0.0,Neutral,0
try it out i'll have a video on my,0.0,Neutral,0
channel um but i wasn't able to,0.5,Positive,1
experience that yet because this product,0.0,Neutral,0
hasn't even come out you can't just go,0.0,Neutral,0
out and public with it another big thing,0.0,Neutral,0
that people want to know about this what,0.0,Neutral,0
is the vision pro like for gaming right,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
so we have support for ios and ipad os,0.0,Neutral,0
apps i mean gaming on here is pretty,-0.03125,Negative,0
ridiculous let's say if you uh apple,-0.3333333333333333,Negative,0
arcade games there's about 250 games on,0.0,Neutral,0
launch so think of this you have a,0.0,Neutral,0
controller that's tied to uh connected,0.0,Neutral,0
over bluetooth and you can basically,0.0,Neutral,0
just have something around it feels like,0.0,Neutral,0
around 150 to 200 in screen smoothly,0.4,Positive,1
just like drag and change the scale of,-0.1,Negative,0
it the fidelity of the image and the,0.0,Neutral,0
resolution of those games does not break,0.0,Neutral,0
down so it doesn't get like all super,0.08888888888888886,Positive,1
extra pixelated the the the image,0.0,Neutral,0
quality still holds true and then you,0.35,Positive,1
have other apps like steam and steamlink,-0.125,Negative,0
you could actually have a game on your,-0.2,Negative,0
pc on the same network with the,0.0,Neutral,0
controller and use that window blow it,0.0,Neutral,0
up really big you can take apple arcade,0.0,Neutral,0
games blow it up really big this is,0.0,Neutral,0
arguably if you want to use it that way,0.0,Neutral,0
your largest biggest and best gaming,1.0,Positive,1
display in your house a lot of the games,0.0,Neutral,0
here on launch um they aren't what i,0.0,Neutral,0
would call like full take over over vr,0.35,Positive,1
type games this is going to take time,0.0,Neutral,0
for developers to get at it so there's,0.0,Neutral,0
fun games like stitch where you're,0.3,Positive,1
you're like you know drawing in kind of,0.6,Positive,1
like it's like a color sluzzle game,-0.4,Negative,0
there's stuff here on launch but you,0.0,Neutral,0
know you got to wait for developers to,0.0,Neutral,0
really get their hands on it um for us,0.2,Positive,1
to see you know games tailor made for,0.0,Neutral,0
this and that's what i hope to see now,0.0,Neutral,0
if there's one word to describe the,0.0,Neutral,0
apple vision pro that word is immersive,0.0,Neutral,0
this is the most,0.5,Positive,1
immersive headset i've ever experienced,0.8,Positive,1
you know i got to um use it and you know,0.0,Neutral,0
test it out in half an hour um hands-on,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
experiences before this review but now,0.0,Neutral,0
that i've had it um from an immersive,0.0,Neutral,0
video standpoint and experience this,0.0,Neutral,0
thing is incredible i mean you first,0.2791666666666667,Positive,1
have those environments that really,0.2,Positive,1
transport and take you away from where,0.0,Neutral,0
you are whether you want to do work,0.0,Neutral,0
while you're in an environment whether,0.0,Neutral,0
you want to watch a movie you know,0.0,Neutral,0
hakala you have yosity you have the this,0.0,Neutral,0
like cool sand area you have hood and,0.35,Positive,1
they have daytime versions nighttime,0.0,Neutral,0
versions they can also change like the,0.0,Neutral,0
weather can change um as well in here,0.0,Neutral,0
but they really transport you to,0.2,Positive,1
different locations you even have,0.0,Neutral,0
something like uh the meditation app,0.0,Neutral,0
that you feel like you're in a different,0.0,Neutral,0
world and then when you start talking,0.0,Neutral,0
about actual immersive video content,0.0,Neutral,0
right we have the apple immersive video,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
platform there's you know a rehearsal,0.0,Neutral,0
stage with alicia keys and this is again,0.0,Neutral,0
their acquisition of next vr you're,0.0,Neutral,0
watching 180 degree video all right in,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
front of you so it basically covers your,0.0,Neutral,0
peripherals uh it's it's shot in 8k it's,0.0,Neutral,0
3d and it supports high dynamic range,0.08,Positive,1
this just it's incredible to see this,0.9,Positive,1
and you you feel it if that makes sense,0.0,Neutral,0
you you actually feel the video and,0.0,Neutral,0
there's not anything out there like that,0.0,Neutral,0
today and then spatial audio on top of,0.5,Positive,1
that that has been able been able to,0.5,Positive,1
capture that just yet also we talk about,0.0,Neutral,0
3d movies apple tv will have 150 3d,0.0,Neutral,0
movies available on launch if you,0.4,Positive,1
already have purchased the movie and,0.0,Neutral,0
it's available in 3d you have the option,0.4,Positive,1
to either watch the 2d version or the 3d,0.0,Neutral,0
version of the movie this is also,0.0,Neutral,0
incredible because you're of course,0.9,Positive,1
you're wearing um you know a headset but,0.0,Neutral,0
you're not wearing actual glasses that,0.0,Neutral,0
you know sometimes you get a screen door,0.0,Neutral,0
effect when there's a lot of action the,0.1,Positive,1
frame rate can break down a tiny bit but,-0.07777777777777779,Negative,0
this is the best looking 3d that i've,1.0,Positive,1
ever seen and i was the 3d junkie who,0.0,Neutral,0
bought you know uh the panasonic tvs,0.0,Neutral,0
back in the day and bought all the,0.0,Neutral,0
different 3d glasses and bought a huge,0.20000000000000004,Positive,1
collection of 3d movies and now tv today,0.0,Neutral,0
don't support it this is the best,1.0,Positive,1
fidelity of a 3d experience we've ever,0.0,Neutral,0
seen it supports high dynamic range uh,0.08,Positive,1
and also sports high frame rate so that,0.16,Positive,1
means movies that are like 48 frames,0.0,Neutral,0
like a avatar way of water you get the,0.0,Neutral,0
original original director's intent in a,0.375,Positive,1
headset like this you throw in the,0.0,Neutral,0
spatial audio it's it's just incredible,0.9,Positive,1
all the things i can do and then look i,0.0,Neutral,0
just had to add this part here because,0.0,Neutral,0
it's important when we talk about the i,0.4,Positive,1
word immersive so when you watch a movie,0.0,Neutral,0
you can go into the cinema view and,0.0,Neutral,0
apple teased that it just doesn't,0.0,Neutral,0
translate as well in the headset and,0.0,Neutral,0
it's really shaky but you can actually,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
get the prime spot whether it's a middle,0.0,Neutral,0
seat front row back row or even up on,0.0,Neutral,0
the balcony and the theater that you're,0.0,Neutral,0
in changes perspective while the movie,0.0,Neutral,0
transitions into these different,0.0,Neutral,0
locations uh it is special and when we,0.35714285714285715,Positive,1
talk about just being in an immersed,0.0,Neutral,0
environment that is another way it does,0.0,Neutral,0
it and then on top of that you have the,0.5,Positive,1
ability to take and record spatial,0.0,Neutral,0
photos or spatial videos from either,0.0,Neutral,0
your iphone 15 pros or take them,0.0,Neutral,0
directly on this device you have this,0.1,Positive,1
top button here on the left side and,0.25,Positive,1
that allows you to when you tap it it,0.0,Neutral,0
puts you in kind of the spatial capture,0.6,Positive,1
mode you either hold it for video you,0.0,Neutral,0
press it once for single photos it saves,-0.07142857142857142,Negative,0
them directly to the device but on your,0.1,Positive,1
phone you kind of get that large wide,0.2380952380952381,Positive,1
landscape aspect ratio for videos and,0.0,Neutral,0
photos and so that's my preference then,0.0,Neutral,0
you just air dropped in here and you can,0.0,Neutral,0
really capture intimate moments that,0.2,Positive,1
just come alive on this headset like,0.1,Positive,1
nothing you've ever seen or experienced,0.8,Positive,1
before so we're talking about from top,0.5,Positive,1
to bottom apple immersive video 3d,0.0,Neutral,0
movies immersive environments and your,0.0,Neutral,0
own personal spatial video this is the,0.3,Positive,1
most immersive headset we have ever seen,0.5,Positive,1
and from someone who loves to consume,0.0,Neutral,0
content this is really special now of,0.35714285714285715,Positive,1
course the question is okay brian you're,0.5,Positive,1
talking about this battery life what do,0.0,Neutral,0
what do we got for battery life well you,0.0,Neutral,0
know with normal use apple said 2 hours,0.15,Positive,1
and then with watching movie apple said,0.0,Neutral,0
2 and 1 half hours but what i can tell,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
you is i put this to the test i've been,0.0,Neutral,0
wearing this a whole lot just for you,0.2,Positive,1
and which is normal normal use we're,0.15,Positive,1
talking about running multiple apps,0.0,Neutral,0
doing facetime calls even playing uh,0.0,Neutral,0
like youtube tv on the side while i'm,0.0,Neutral,0
doing other things playing music i was,-0.125,Negative,0
able to push this out um for 2 hours and,0.5,Positive,1
26 minutes so it's almost we time out 2,0.0,Neutral,0
and 1/2 hours of normal day-to-day use,0.15,Positive,1
and i was pushing a lot harder than i,-0.1,Negative,0
even would in a normal way but that's,0.15,Positive,1
good to know right at least from a from,0.22857142857142856,Positive,1
a day-to-day real world you're basically,0.2,Positive,1
getting around 2 and a half hours now,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
for watching a 3d movie i made it all,0.0,Neutral,0
the way through avengers endgame and,0.0,Neutral,0
then i just had like a couple minutes,0.0,Neutral,0
extra of juice this headset for a movie,0.0,Neutral,0
3d movie lasted 3 hours and 9 minutes so,0.0,Neutral,0
what that tells you is that both of the,0.0,Neutral,0
whether it's using it for regular use or,0.0,Neutral,0
using it for movies both were about half,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
an hour more than what apple officially,0.5,Positive,1
stated battery lifewise which has been,0.0,Neutral,0
typical for apple but at least you know,-0.23333333333333334,Negative,0
now it's really real world 2 and a half,0.016666666666666677,Positive,1
hours of day-to-day use and then three,0.0,Neutral,0
plus hours of watching a movie and,0.0,Neutral,0
that's really incredible now you have,0.9,Positive,1
your battery right if you need to,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
recharge it it it takes one and a half,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
hours to go from zero all the way to,0.0,Neutral,0
100% i did just for fun a 30-minute,0.3,Positive,1
charge and i got it to 37% so yes you do,0.0,Neutral,0
need a battery pack and there will be,0.0,Neutral,0
caveats that come with that as well so,0.0,Neutral,0
look i've been saying a lot of great,0.8,Positive,1
things about the apple vision pro and,0.0,Neutral,0
again there is nothing out there like it,0.0,Neutral,0
but there's obviously this is the first,0.125,Positive,1
gen there's some things some drawbacks,0.0,Neutral,0
that you need to know about and i'm sure,0.5,Positive,1
some of these things that are missing,-0.2,Negative,0
will likely you know come in time again,0.0,Neutral,0
this is this is day one of this device,0.0,Neutral,0
um but i think the big one of the first,0.125,Positive,1
things i noticed is you know you,0.0,Neutral,0
download all these different apps but,0.0,Neutral,0
there is no app customiz ation right now,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
meaning after apple's apps on the home,0.0,Neutral,0
screen the rest of the apps are actually,0.0,Neutral,0
listed alphabetically so you currently,0.0,Neutral,0
cannot move them around or customize the,0.0,Neutral,0
layout um create a different order or,0.0,Neutral,0
even create folders to group your apps,0.0,Neutral,0
together you do have compatible iphone,0.0,Neutral,0
and ipad apps um those are in the,0.0,Neutral,0
compatible apps folder um you could also,0.0,Neutral,0
use siri to launch an app specifically,0.0,Neutral,0
or you can go to control center and then,-0.1,Negative,0
use spotlight to find an app but you,0.0,Neutral,0
know right out of the gates you're kind,0.44285714285714284,Positive,1
of like thinking that oh i can customize,0.0,Neutral,0
this like ios you can't right now we,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
also have youtube and netflix right,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
those they do not have native apps they,0.0,Neutral,0
don't have compatible apps that they,0.0,Neutral,0
ported over from uh ipad os so my hope,0.0,Neutral,0
was that i could you know go to the,0.0,Neutral,0
website and then add it as an app on my,0.0,Neutral,0
home screen uh you are not able to do,-0.25,Negative,0
that so that's pretty inconvenient,-0.175,Negative,0
because look netflix youtube and youtube,0.0,Neutral,0
tv those are three services that i use,0.0,Neutral,0
quite a lot and i'd like to at least be,-0.3,Negative,0
able to hey take that you know web page,0.5,Positive,1
and turn it into a web app you can't do,0.0,Neutral,0
that right now um as of day one so it is,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
inconvenient um my hope is that this,-0.6,Negative,0
gets resolved and so for now that's,0.0,Neutral,0
something that you can't do now will,0.0,Neutral,0
this stop me from saying oh get this,0.0,Neutral,0
device i think it's obviously an,0.0,Neutral,0
inconvenience but let's give them the,0.0,Neutral,0
benefit of down in i'm pretty sure it'll,0.19814814814814816,Positive,1
be worked out but what you could do,0.0,Neutral,0
right now is you know set one as your,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
homepage in safari as it launches or you,0.0,Neutral,0
know create them as favorites now also,0.0,Neutral,0
things to be aware of right this is a,0.26785714285714285,Positive,1
list of more caveats battery swap right,0.39285714285714285,Positive,1
now,0.0,Neutral,0
remember this device it hasn't changed,0.0,Neutral,0
once this battery runs out if you want,0.0,Neutral,0
to like you know change over to a new,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
battery there is no time where oh it has,0.0,Neutral,0
like you know you can't like hot swap it,0.25,Positive,1
and this is still running the actual,0.0,Neutral,0
apple vision pro will shut down once you,-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
remove a battery and connect a new one,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
but the time is not too bad i mean i put,-0.5062499999999999,Negative,0
in a battery fully charged from start,0.0,Neutral,0
and you know from from a cold start it,-0.6,Negative,0
takes about 37 seconds to warm up you're,0.6,Positive,1
going to hear this um deep bright chime,0.35000000000000003,Positive,1
that is a little different sounding,-0.09375,Negative,0
specifically for apple vision pro and,0.0,Neutral,0
once you hear that chime you can put,0.0,Neutral,0
this on your head and then in about 5,0.0,Neutral,0
more seconds you'll see an apple logo,0.5,Positive,1
and then the video feed shows up inside,0.0,Neutral,0
the apple vision pro but right now once,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
you swap batteries the power will turn,0.0,Neutral,0
off and then you'll have to wait for it,0.0,Neutral,0
to boot up again also i think one of the,0.0,Neutral,0
things that i noticed over time um is,0.0,Neutral,0
movie lens reflections and what do i,0.0,Neutral,0
mean by that so you know this happens in,-0.3125,Negative,0
other vr headsets but specifically when,-0.125,Negative,0
maybe there's some really bright scenes,0.7000000000000001,Positive,1
it's kind of funny like the displays are,0.425,Positive,1
so good and the high dynamic range is so,0.2866666666666667,Positive,1
good when you have certain scenes in,0.45714285714285713,Positive,1
movies that are really bright you'll,0.7000000000000001,Positive,1
sometime it'll sometimes reflect because,0.0,Neutral,0
you're looking through lenses and these,0.0,Neutral,0
are curved lenses you'll see a little,-0.1875,Negative,0
bit of like some reflections on the edge,0.0,Neutral,0
now there is a really sweet spot to see,0.35,Positive,1
the video like when you're watching,0.0,Neutral,0
movies but it can happen um and look i'm,0.0,Neutral,0
just letting you know that it's it's not,0.0,Neutral,0
something that is going to you're going,0.0,Neutral,0
to hate i think the ultimate video file,-0.4,Negative,0
will will probably be a little annoyed,-0.29375,Negative,0
by it i noticed it because i'm the,0.0,Neutral,0
person who like you know gets the 4k,0.0,Neutral,0
oleds and pays attention all that stuff,0.0,Neutral,0
so it's a little distracting it happens,-0.1875,Negative,0
in some scenes but also i noticed,0.0,Neutral,0
because a lot of the demos are typically,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
in bright rooms when it when you're in a,0.7000000000000001,Positive,1
bright room or bright environment you,0.7000000000000001,Positive,1
actually don't really see the,0.2,Positive,1
reflections that much it's only when i,0.0,Neutral,0
was pitch black in a room or pitch black,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
in an environment where i could see a,0.0,Neutral,0
little bit of it it's just something to,-0.1875,Negative,0
let you know it's really dynamic scenes,0.0,Neutral,0
that are bright now i think the biggest,0.7000000000000001,Positive,1
thing that everyone knows and has heard,0.0,Neutral,0
about it is the weight of the headset,0.0,Neutral,0
and i will tell you that you will feel,0.0,Neutral,0
this right 30 minutes in for me it gets,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
a little uncomfortable 45 minutes to an,-0.34375,Negative,0
hour is really the most that i can use,0.35,Positive,1
it for like straight through but like i,0.2,Positive,1
told you to test um using it dayto day i,0.0,Neutral,0
kept it on for two almost two and a half,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
hours to watch a movie and see how long,-0.05,Negative,0
it lasted i kept it on for 3 plus hours,0.0,Neutral,0
but i know that in a normal situation if,0.15,Positive,1
i wasn't doing that for you all um i,0.0,Neutral,0
would not be able to wear it that long i,0.225,Positive,1
personally need to take breaks so for me,0.0,Neutral,0
45 minutes to an hour was the absolute,0.2,Positive,1
like threshold for me to be like i need,0.0,Neutral,0
to take a breather from this you know,0.0,Neutral,0
even i i'll be honest with you after two,0.6,Positive,1
days i didn't realize it but like i,0.0,Neutral,0
touched over here and i got you know,0.0,Neutral,0
it's this is an all new device this is,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
things that we haven't done before i i,0.0,Neutral,0
got a little like a little bit of,-0.1875,Negative,0
tenderness around my forehead after two,0.0,Neutral,0
days it didn't stop me from using it but,0.0,Neutral,0
i did feel it and that was something,0.0,Neutral,0
different so for me someone needs to,0.0,Neutral,0
make a headset um that can help,0.0,Neutral,0
distribute the weight better there is,0.5,Positive,1
the dual band loop that does help but,0.0,Neutral,0
even with that i still after you know,0.0,Neutral,0
once i hit that 45 minute mark,0.0,Neutral,0
specifically then i'm like oh i need to,0.0,Neutral,0
take these off i might be able to push,0.5,Positive,1
it out to an hour but that's when i felt,0.0,Neutral,0
it some of you might feel it earlier,0.0,Neutral,0
some of you might not i think that quite,0.0,Neutral,0
honestly people with bigger heads it,0.3,Positive,1
helps distribute the weight a little,-0.1875,Negative,0
better for you because it's pulled uh,0.5,Positive,1
wider but i hope either apple works on,0.0,Neutral,0
making something that has a little bit,-0.1875,Negative,0
of a counterweight to pull this off your,0.0,Neutral,0
face we know like with other brand like,-0.125,Negative,0
meta the quest 3 and the quest 2 they've,0.0,Neutral,0
had that elite strap with like the,0.0,Neutral,0
battery pack here that just helps lift,0.0,Neutral,0
it a little bit um the weight difference,-0.1875,Negative,0
here this is around 600 to 650 g the,0.0,Neutral,0
meta quest 3 is like 5 515 g so this is,0.0,Neutral,0
a little heavier it's not significantly,-0.1875,Negative,0
heavier but no matter what every headset,0.0,Neutral,0
you wear you will feel the weight and i,0.0,Neutral,0
felt the weight here so i'm hoping that,0.0,Neutral,0
we can get other um head head strap,-0.125,Negative,0
options that might alleviate that a,0.0,Neutral,0
little bit the other thing that i didn't,-0.15625,Negative,0
really think of and didn't expect is um,0.2,Positive,1
when i use this i think i'm get i get a,0.0,Neutral,0
little more exhausted than normal,0.015624999999999993,Positive,1
because uh there's just a lot i'm over,0.0,Neutral,0
stimulated like this is definitely using,0.0,Neutral,0
our brain in different ways and there's,0.0,Neutral,0
so much sensory overload from the video,0.2,Positive,1
feed from me looking around from me like,0.0,Neutral,0
swiping in graphics from things like,0.0,Neutral,0
just like coming at me i can tell that i,0.0,Neutral,0
definitely get a little fatigued after,-0.09375,Negative,0
using after using that so that's why i,0.0,Neutral,0
also need to take a break and i again to,0.0,Neutral,0
my point is i think this is triggering,0.0,Neutral,0
our brain to uh act and take in,0.0,Neutral,0
information uh just cu there's just,0.0,Neutral,0
there's just so much there and it's,0.2,Positive,1
exciting like don't get me wrong it is,-0.1,Negative,0
really fun and i i love being inside it,0.4,Positive,1
but it can also be a little exhausting,-0.29375,Negative,0
from over stimulation so i think maybe,0.0,Neutral,0
part of it is i've been a week into it,0.0,Neutral,0
now i'm learning to maybe slow down the,-0.2277777777777778,Negative,0
way i use it a lot of times when you're,0.0,Neutral,0
you're looking at things because you,0.0,Neutral,0
want to jump around so fast you know you,0.2,Positive,1
might want to you know tap to select,0.0,Neutral,0
something and you're already looking at,0.0,Neutral,0
the next thing just take your time a,0.0,Neutral,0
little bit in it also i did test it um,-0.1875,Negative,0
using it in the dark more and when it's,0.175,Positive,1
too dark it will tell you where it may,-0.15,Negative,0
not be able to see your hand as well,0.5,Positive,1
there are ir illuminators here on the,0.0,Neutral,0
bottom that you can still use this in,0.0,Neutral,0
the dark but when it gets too too dark,-0.15,Negative,0
or certain situations it will warn you,0.21428571428571427,Positive,1
that it may not be able to see your,0.5,Positive,1
hands as well um but it still can be,0.0,Neutral,0
used um i didn't have a problem with it,0.0,Neutral,0
but i just want to let you know the even,0.0,Neutral,0
sometimes uh like some of the sensors it,0.0,Neutral,0
would at least give you a warning when,-0.3,Negative,0
it it couldn't see them as well so just,0.0,Neutral,0
be aware of this i think this definitely,0.125,Positive,1
performs the best in well light,0.7,Positive,1
conditions it doesn't perform poorly in,-0.4,Negative,0
darker situations it just may not be as,0.0,Neutral,0
as effective when you get those warnings,0.6,Positive,1
but also i think another thing that i've,0.0,Neutral,0
noticed that i wasn't expecting is this,0.0,Neutral,0
tap move you know when when we were,0.0,Neutral,0
using the iphone we were using like our,0.0,Neutral,0
thumbs a lot and i would always joke,0.0,Neutral,0
like oh man i'm building,0.0,Neutral,0
ips this tap move there i mean i you,-0.3125,Negative,0
know when you're using it so much,0.2,Positive,1
you even get fatigued here too so again,0.0,Neutral,0
we're using these new devices in,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
different ways and our body is having to,0.0,Neutral,0
adjust to that but guess what we adjust,0.0,Neutral,0
uh this thing is still unreal,0.0,Neutral,0
so we've talked all about that the,0.0,Neutral,0
caveats of what makes this great what,0.8,Positive,1
makes this special how immersive this is,0.35714285714285715,Positive,1
and then some of the things that oh,0.0,Neutral,0
maybe you might consider okay what what,0.5,Positive,1
are some of the challeng that come with,0.0,Neutral,0
this for you know the first time that,0.25,Positive,1
apple's put on a headset but i think,0.0,Neutral,0
obviously the biggest thing that,0.0,Neutral,0
everyone talks about is not only the,0.0,Neutral,0
comfortable comfortability is that a,0.4,Positive,1
word how comfortable this is uh you know,0.4,Positive,1
the weight of the headset but the price,0.0,Neutral,0
right and let's be honest i've said this,0.44285714285714284,Positive,1
multiple times this is not priced as a,0.0,Neutral,0
headset for everyone we know this right,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
i don't expect everyone to go out and,0.0,Neutral,0
buy this but everything i've showed you,0.0,Neutral,0
it's up to you to make that,0.0,Neutral,0
determination of if this is worth,0.3,Positive,1
"3,499 starting you saw my pre-order",0.0,Neutral,0
video it pushed up because i got an,0.0,Neutral,0
extra battery i got the highest capacity,0.0,Neutral,0
got apple care it basically ps it to,0.0,Neutral,0
"near 5,000 that's a huge investment i",0.25000000000000006,Positive,1
cover tech for a living but that's a,0.0,Neutral,0
decision that you have to figure out for,0.0,Neutral,0
yourself i think first of all no matter,0.25,Positive,1
what through this whole video this is a,0.2,Positive,1
device that i highly recommend that you,0.16,Positive,1
go to an apple store if there's one near,0.1,Positive,1
you go through the demo process feel it,0.0,Neutral,0
out it experience it i think it's going,0.0,Neutral,0
to be really exciting you're be like oh,0.3,Positive,1
my gosh oh my gosh but just do that,0.0,Neutral,0
first before you make a decision i know,0.25,Positive,1
there's a lot of people that bought,0.0,Neutral,0
bought this and purchased it side unseen,0.0,Neutral,0
and you know that is that is the true,0.35,Positive,1
you know apple believer the also someone,0.0,Neutral,0
who just wants to be on the cutting edge,-0.19999999999999998,Negative,0
of tech this is the cutting edge of,-0.6,Negative,0
technology there's nothing out there,0.0,Neutral,0
like it we will see what the future,0.0,Neutral,0
holds and what direction um this pushes,0.0,Neutral,0
things and where people move towards but,0.0,Neutral,0
obviously apple in this for long haul,-0.025,Negative,0
but you've you've got to try it on for,0.0,Neutral,0
most people this is a huge investment,0.45000000000000007,Positive,1
this is a luxury device uh but you know,0.0,Neutral,0
i'm i'm loving it i'm already loving it,0.6,Positive,1
uh i can't wait to see where this is,0.0,Neutral,0
honestly in 3 to 5 years when it's going,0.6,Positive,1
to get lighter in weight it's going to,0.0,Neutral,0
get more comfortable the price will,0.45,Positive,1
likely be a little more affordable i'm,0.10416666666666667,Positive,1
not going to no anyone who's asking for,0.0,Neutral,0
a 500 headset from apple uh that's not,0.0,Neutral,0
happening anytime soon this this is the,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro and this is uh just the build,0.0,Neutral,0
quality alone would would not get it to,0.0,Neutral,0
that area so don't don't think of it,0.0,Neutral,0
that way look at all the tech in here,0.0,Neutral,0
and look at all the experiences that,0.0,Neutral,0
i've been tried to convey to you and,0.0,Neutral,0
this is an incredible incredible piece,0.9,Positive,1
of technology this is up to you to,0.0,Neutral,0
decide for yourself is it worth it or,0.3,Positive,1
not and also all that chatter about this,0.0,Neutral,0
is a beta product,0.0,Neutral,0
um using it,0.0,Neutral,0
it doesn't feel like a beta product you,0.0,Neutral,0
know this is a polished product,0.0,Neutral,0
developers yes have to get on it the,0.0,Neutral,0
price is not you know the most consumer,0.5,Positive,1
friendly it's not we can all say that,0.375,Positive,1
admit that but for people that haven't,0.0,Neutral,0
used it that are just outright calling,0.0,Neutral,0
this uh you know a dev kit i think,0.0,Neutral,0
that's selling it short and use it just,0.0,Neutral,0
from a pure entertainment standpoint,0.21428571428571427,Positive,1
it's prime time already and again it's,0.0,Neutral,0
only going to get better like i'm,0.25,Positive,1
excited to see what developers do and,0.375,Positive,1
what apple does with this product over,0.0,Neutral,0
time i think if you love tech and you,0.5,Positive,1
want to experience something you have,0.0,Neutral,0
never ever ever have before and you have,0.0,Neutral,0
the resources then you should get an,0.0,Neutral,0
apple vision pro if you don't have the,0.0,Neutral,0
resources to do it look don't do it like,0.0,Neutral,0
these are the grown up decisions that we,0.0,Neutral,0
all make for ourselves we all value,0.0,Neutral,0
things differently right it's up to you,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
to decide if it's worth it to you after,0.3,Positive,1
everything i've shown you because for,0.0,Neutral,0
everyone that loves their fancy handbag,0.0,Neutral,0
and i know a lot of you have multiple,0.0,Neutral,0
handbags hey this is my fancy handbag,0.0,Neutral,0
and you know if it's too expensive for,-0.5,Negative,0
most people which it is like i don't,0.5,Positive,1
expect everyone to get one i really,0.2,Positive,1
don't just follow along with this,0.0,Neutral,0
journey the it's going to um develop in,0.0,Neutral,0
so many incredible ways we still don't,0.7,Positive,1
know if this will be a true success,0.32499999999999996,Positive,1
however that's defined but we know that,0.0,Neutral,0
apple is in this for the long haul uh,-0.05,Negative,0
you know all of apple's dna is in here,0.0,Neutral,0
from design from software from,0.0,Neutral,0
compatibility with all their other,-0.125,Negative,0
platforms and products and you know even,0.0,Neutral,0
the media relationships they have like,0.0,Neutral,0
this is everything you know for all,0.0,Neutral,0
these years put into here and every time,0.0,Neutral,0
i jump in it just feels like i'm using,0.0,Neutral,0
the next frontier of computing and,0.0,Neutral,0
entertainment that is just right on the,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
horizon we'll see if we actually get,0.0,Neutral,0
there we'll see if everyone gets there,0.0,Neutral,0
right there's still considerations the,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
comfort the price yes but the,0.0,Neutral,0
experiences that this has the they they,0.0,Neutral,0
they they're already they're already,0.0,Neutral,0
changing my brain a little bit like this,-0.1875,Negative,0
is really wild stuff i mean someone,-0.10625,Negative,0
who's loved tech and has followed this,0.7,Positive,1
for all these years that when you see,0.0,Neutral,0
something like this that can do that to,0.0,Neutral,0
you like that that's what it's all about,0.0,Neutral,0
it is appropriate that the time of this,0.5,Positive,1
comes um just within a week of the 40th,0.0,Neutral,0
anniversary of the mac because that was,0.0,Neutral,0
a paradigm shift in how we saw computing,0.0,Neutral,0
and how we worked and interacted with,0.0,Neutral,0
computers and how accessible it was this,0.375,Positive,1
feels like another shift that is,0.0,Neutral,0
happening and could happen i'm not,0.0,Neutral,0
saying it's going to but the way that we,0.0,Neutral,0
interact with windows and media and,0.0,Neutral,0
content and the immersive nature i'm not,0.0,Neutral,0
saying like we're all going to be,0.0,Neutral,0
wearing these outside every day but all,0.0,Neutral,0
the learnings that are com that are,0.0,Neutral,0
coming from here and as this gets,0.0,Neutral,0
smaller and lighter it's it's going to,0.0,Neutral,0
take us in new places and this this,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
really feels like it introduces a whole,0.2,Positive,1
new world and a whole new shift of what,0.15757575757575756,Positive,1
is possible with technology and bottom,0.0,Neutral,0
line look this is the most amazing piece,0.55,Positive,1
of tech that i have ever ever,0.0,Neutral,0
experienced in my life and this is just,0.8,Positive,1
scratching the surface of its potential,0.0,Neutral,0
and that is an exciting uh development,0.3,Positive,1
in itself you know you wonder like am i,0.0,Neutral,0
saying go run out and get right now no,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
you don't have to follow along make the,0.0,Neutral,0
decision for yourself you're a grownup,0.0,Neutral,0
but hopefully what i showed you um could,0.0,Neutral,0
really inform you and be like oh wow wow,0.13333333333333333,Positive,1
i see why this is special or what this,0.35714285714285715,Positive,1
does and why you really yeah it's a,0.2,Positive,1
headset but you can't you can't compare,0.0,Neutral,0
it to anything out there you just can't,0.0,Neutral,0
there there's nothing out there like,0.0,Neutral,0
that so if you want my final verdict,0.0,Neutral,0
right good apple bad apple guess what,0.09523809523809527,Positive,1
nothing like this has ever been done,0.0,Neutral,0
this is a blow my mind apple i i i still,0.0,Neutral,0
can't comprehend like everything that i,0.0,Neutral,0
feel about this thing it's it's freaking,0.0,Neutral,0
incredible apple vision pro you blow my,0.9,Positive,1
music,0.0,Neutral,0
music,0.0,Neutral,0
mind,0.0,Neutral,0
all right vision,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
pro so everyone this is my review of the,0.0,Neutral,0
apple uh vision pro and i got it um like,0.0,Neutral,0
um you know when it was released,0.0,Neutral,0
obviously from the united states because,0.0,Neutral,0
you couldn't get it anywhere else and uh,0.0,Neutral,0
this thing is interesting it's not i,0.5,Positive,1
think uh where we are headed right now,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
in the future it's going to look much,0.1,Positive,1
different like i believe as the mobile,0.0,Neutral,0
phones have been so common there would,-0.3,Negative,0
be smart glasses that would become,0.21428571428571427,Positive,1
common but this is just my uh initial,-0.15,Negative,0
thoughts and how i use my um vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
and if it's worth it uh i got this one,0.3,Positive,1
for uh,0.0,Neutral,0
"4,000 um and the case which is also",0.0,Neutral,0
really nice that um came for an extra,0.3,Positive,1
300 um so total i think um yeah 400,0.0,Neutral,0
"4, 300 or something and uh that's uh i",0.0,Neutral,0
don't know close to 3.5 lakhs but is it,0.0,Neutral,0
worth it uh spoiler,0.3,Positive,1
alert i don't know it's it's really,0.2,Positive,1
interesting okay let's get started so,0.5,Positive,1
the vision pro um is essentially it's a,0.0,Neutral,0
head headset like as you can see like a,0.0,Neutral,0
vr headset and you can do a bunch of,0.0,Neutral,0
things with it it's pretty cool like mk,0.3,Positive,1
kbst said the the technology is old,0.1,Positive,1
because the cameras and the oled screens,0.0,Neutral,0
or whatever we have already had that but,0.0,Neutral,0
it's in a new format right um is it,0.21103896103896103,Positive,1
worth 3 and a half lakh rupees um no not,0.06666666666666667,Positive,1
right not right now i think for me it's,0.07142857142857142,Positive,1
a very expensive toy uh and uh but it's,-0.65,Negative,0
pretty cool i do use it and i do have,0.3,Positive,1
fun fun with it one other thing i want,0.15833333333333333,Positive,1
to share about the vision pro is when,0.0,Neutral,0
you're checking the transparency mode,0.0,Neutral,0
although it's one of the best that i've,1.0,Positive,1
seen in any vr but it's still like a,0.0,Neutral,0
camera projection i think the latency is,0.0,Neutral,0
like 6 milliseconds or something it's,0.0,Neutral,0
not like you're transparently seeing,0.0,Neutral,0
through the glass which i believe would,0.0,Neutral,0
be awesome because you be actually,0.5,Positive,1
seeing the real world this feels like a,0.2,Positive,1
high quality image being projected in,0.16,Positive,1
your eyes it's really fast so it doesn't,0.2,Positive,1
feel like um laggy but it still doesn't,0.0,Neutral,0
feel like obviously as good as as your,0.7,Positive,1
natural eyes maybe in the future they,0.05,Positive,1
can have like a transparent uh glass or,0.0,Neutral,0
something right so it has uh a lot of,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
cameras on it and uh this is just a,0.0,Neutral,0
little flap that comes off it's magnetic,-0.1875,Negative,0
and they when you go to the apple store,0.0,Neutral,0
or if you buy online they do a 3d scan,0.0,Neutral,0
of your face and then they give it to,0.0,Neutral,0
you according to your face so that when,0.0,Neutral,0
you put it on the the light doesn't pass,0.4,Positive,1
through your your cheekbones anyway,0.0,Neutral,0
inside,0.0,Neutral,0
check check so when you put it on the,0.0,Neutral,0
light doesn't pass through your uh your,0.4,Positive,1
cheekbones anyway inside you can see,0.0,Neutral,0
there are two big screens now these are,0.0,Neutral,0
very high definition i i'm using the,0.20800000000000002,Positive,1
simple language high definition because,0.08,Positive,1
you can check the actual numbers online,0.0,Neutral,0
but i think more than a 4k tv um in in,0.5,Positive,1
short if i if i watch a movie on this it,0.0,Neutral,0
literally it does feel like i'm in a,0.0,Neutral,0
cinema hall yeah pretty cool i'll show,0.3,Positive,1
you a demo of that but uh no this is,0.0,Neutral,0
pretty cool and uh then you get this,0.3,Positive,1
band with it you can you get an extra,0.0,Neutral,0
cushion but you also get uh this band,0.0,Neutral,0
with it so that goes behind your head,-0.4,Negative,0
and um you get this extra band which,0.0,Neutral,0
makes it a bit more comfortable to wear,0.45,Positive,1
in my opinion it has been a lot more,0.5,Positive,1
comfortable uh wearing this uh loop pan,0.4,Positive,1
but uh you order to wear it you just put,0.0,Neutral,0
it on like this oh but you have to put,0.0,Neutral,0
in the battery first forgot about that,0.25,Positive,1
so the,0.0,Neutral,0
"battery is uh i think 3,000",0.0,Neutral,0
milliamp or something but the thing is,0.0,Neutral,0
this is a downside so this only lasts,0.0,Neutral,0
like 2 hours and um that's like one of,0.0,Neutral,0
the downsides of the vision pro in order,0.0,Neutral,0
to plug in the battery do not ever hold,0.0,Neutral,0
it from this case because then it would,0.0,Neutral,0
come off because it's magnetic so it,0.0,Neutral,0
would fall off um you have to align the,0.0,Neutral,0
battery to the battery slot and then,0.0,Neutral,0
twist it and it also comes with a it,0.0,Neutral,0
also comes with a case,0.0,Neutral,0
cover so you can put it like this and,0.0,Neutral,0
protect your vision pro but uh when i,0.0,Neutral,0
put it on you can just do it like this,0.0,Neutral,0
and i can tighten it up you can uh click,0.0,Neutral,0
the crown and uh it will show you a,0.0,Neutral,0
bunch of options now the best part is,1.0,Positive,1
how you select these options so you can,0.0,Neutral,0
just literally drag like your hand like,-0.1,Negative,0
this you can drag your hand and it feels,-0.1,Negative,0
like uh magic and if you want to click,0.5,Positive,1
on something if you want to select an,0.0,Neutral,0
icon let's say i want to open settings i,0.0,Neutral,0
can just look at settings with my eyes,0.0,Neutral,0
obviously and i will just do pinch and,0.0,Neutral,0
it will open it up so it's pretty cool,0.19999999999999998,Positive,1
and then you see downstairs um what i'm,0.0,Neutral,0
saying downstairs when you see down uh,-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
there's actually like a bar and ac cross,0.0,Neutral,0
so if i press cross obviously it will,0.0,Neutral,0
close the window but if you don't want,0.0,Neutral,0
to see your surrounding you want to see,0.0,Neutral,0
something else that you can look at the,0.0,Neutral,0
landscape and you can turn the crown and,0.0,Neutral,0
it will immerse you back into like a,0.0,Neutral,0
different place and i can also hear the,0.0,Neutral,0
rain sounds this i think is pretty cool,0.3,Positive,1
it really feels like really high quality,0.18,Positive,1
it doesn't feel cheap in terms of the,0.4,Positive,1
vision and it does feel like it's like,0.0,Neutral,0
right in front of me so let me show you,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
some of the aming other cool features,0.11249999999999999,Positive,1

cinema for imax let me just show you,0.0,Neutral,0
what the imax looks like so i think this,0.0,Neutral,0
is a really cool uh feature because it,0.35,Positive,1
feels like you're in a theater because,0.0,Neutral,0
they have mimicked the theater so if i,0.0,Neutral,0
just click on this trailer play the,0.0,Neutral,0
trailer for example you might not be,0.0,Neutral,0
able to see in the video but if i play,0.5,Positive,1
it and i reduce the sound a little,0.10625000000000001,Positive,1
bit it does feel like i'm in a theater,0.0,Neutral,0
so you can see imax is written over,0.0,Neutral,0
there and there are some fake uh exit,-0.5,Negative,0
doors over there the railing over there,0.0,Neutral,0
so it does feel like i'm in a theater,0.0,Neutral,0
and it feel feels like really high,0.16,Positive,1
quality as well like 4k hdr dolby vision,0.0,Neutral,0
whatever and i can also pick the seat,0.0,Neutral,0

watch a movie like with a view you can,0.0,Neutral,0
make it bigger if you want see so big,0.0,Neutral,0

macbook,0.0,Neutral,0
screen i can make it big and these are,0.0,Neutral,0
my laptop and my sorry monitor and,-0.5,Negative,0
keyboard so i can just edit my macbook,0.0,Neutral,0
screen and go to,0.0,Neutral,0
safari right weird thing is i can't see,-0.10714285714285715,Negative,0
my keyboard so you need to have touch,0.0,Neutral,0
typing enabled maybe you can work here,0.0,Neutral,0
and you can have your music playing here,0.0,Neutral,0
in the background somewhere you can work,0.0,Neutral,0
here you can have your your twitter,0.0,Neutral,0
somewhere here like,0.0,Neutral,0
this right,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
can it's so cool like the hand it thing,0.35,Positive,1
this thing never gets old it's like been,0.1,Positive,1
playing around with it for a while and,0.0,Neutral,0
it's just so cool like,0.35,Positive,1
retweet not now,0.0,Neutral,0
retweet whatever um really cool really,0.275,Positive,1
cool yeah very,0.275,Positive,1
cool all right moving on so let's see,0.31785714285714284,Positive,1
what else it has i'm going to close the,0.0,Neutral,0
mac window just put this here i'll close,0.0,Neutral,0
this as well music i'll,0.0,Neutral,0
close um photos i showed you web,0.0,Neutral,0
browsing pretty standard like you can,0.125,Positive,1
have uh,0.0,Neutral,0
proper web browsing also the text is,0.0,Neutral,0
really sharp also you can do it like,-0.125,Negative,0
this this is like pretty tony stock like,0.25,Positive,1
i know it's a bit cringe what i'm saying,0.0,Neutral,0
but it it does feel like magic just,0.5,Positive,1
doing this very,0.2,Positive,1
cool um you have your notes your app,0.35,Positive,1
store about the app store there's a,0.0,Neutral,0
limitation that you can also that you,0.0,Neutral,0
can only use um the i can't see but,0.0,Neutral,0
anyway there's a limitation that you can,0.0,Neutral,0
only use an apple us id,0.0,Neutral,0
so if i go to the app store right now,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
because i'm logged in with my uk or,0.0,Neutral,0
india id it will say that it is not,0.0,Neutral,0
available in your country then how do,0.4,Positive,1
you get all the benefits is it like you,0.0,Neutral,0
have to make a new id and then lose out,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
on the photos that you have the music,0.0,Neutral,0
that you have the subscriptions that you,0.0,Neutral,0
have the disney plus and everything that,0.0,Neutral,0
you have that doesn't really matter,0.2,Positive,1
because it's not tied to apple but for,0.0,Neutral,0
example your apple icloud data so like,0.0,Neutral,0
your photos your music will that all be,0.0,Neutral,0
lost because you would not be able to,0.5,Positive,1
sign in with two ids that is correct but,0.0,Neutral,0
there's a work around it what i do is i,0.0,Neutral,0
just made a us apple id and whenever i,0.0,Neutral,0
want to install an application from the,0.0,Neutral,0
app store i log in with the us apple id,0.0,Neutral,0
i install that application then i just,0.0,Neutral,0
sign out and log in with my normal id,0.15,Positive,1
and i get all my songs and all my notes,0.0,Neutral,0
and all my all my photos and everything,0.0,Neutral,0
so it is is it really a problem not,0.2,Positive,1
really because i don't download apps,0.2,Positive,1
that many times i just download once and,0.5,Positive,1
when i don't do want to download some,0.0,Neutral,0
new one i will just sign out sign in,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
with my us id which is free to create,0.4,Positive,1
easy to create then i'll sign out and,0.43333333333333335,Positive,1
sign in with my original id and i will,0.375,Positive,1
use it like i'm using any other apple,-0.125,Negative,0
device so is it really a deal breaker,0.2,Positive,1
for you to get it because of the region,0.0,Neutral,0
limitations i don't think so so which is,0.0,Neutral,0
why you know i have all my photos now,0.0,Neutral,0
synced to icloud my notes my music that,0.0,Neutral,0
i just showed you everything my email,0.0,Neutral,0
and all sorts of things mindfulness i,0.0,Neutral,0

really high quality it's nice yeah begin,0.38,Positive,1
by focusing on your breath all,0.0,Neutral,0
right it's good enough now i'm bor,0.32857142857142857,Positive,1
anyway in yeah i got it anyway uh close,0.0,Neutral,0
it uh apple tv free form let me try,0.4,Positive,1
that and create a new,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
drawing,0.0,Neutral,0

interesting i'm never doing that so it's,0.5,Positive,1
a it's a cool toy i would say if you're,0.35,Positive,1
doing your keynote presentation you can,0.0,Neutral,0

judge,0.0,Neutral,0
me but let's see how powerpoint works in,0.0,Neutral,0

that lights up what's lights up,0.0,Neutral,0
ah environment i can go to,0.0,Neutral,0
theater so cool it's like i'm i'm i'm,0.35,Positive,1
speaking in a theater like keynote,0.0,Neutral,0
speaker going to practice your keynote,0.0,Neutral,0
sessions you know get the vision pro no,0.0,Neutral,0
it's a being,0.0,Neutral,0
sarcastic very cool yeah you can also,0.27749999999999997,Positive,1
sing maybe have an orchestra i'm not,0.0,Neutral,0
going to sing,0.0,Neutral,0
but what is this okay so i can interact,0.5,Positive,1
with the birds and the dinosaurs that,0.0,Neutral,0
show,0.0,Neutral,0
up,0.0,Neutral,0
okay yeah so when i was doing the demo,0.5,Positive,1
at the come on my finger come on my,0.0,Neutral,0
finger,0.0,Neutral,0
come,0.0,Neutral,0
on,0.0,Neutral,0
oh,0.0,Neutral,0
interesting um,0.5,Positive,1
oh it's a window,0.0,Neutral,0
opening in front of my wall so you can,0.0,Neutral,0
actually ah can see it it's like 3d but,0.0,Neutral,0
when i was doing a demo they showed me a,0.0,Neutral,0
demo of uh football matches and baseball,0.0,Neutral,0
matches so was like you're right you,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
know in the stadium which felt pretty,0.25,Positive,1
cool all right so i used it for like i,0.31785714285714284,Positive,1
don't know it it didn't feel like it it,0.0,Neutral,0
was like 20 minutes or something but uh,0.0,Neutral,0
uh impressions um i strain is there any,0.0,Neutral,0
i strain uh i don't think there was much,0.2,Positive,1
maybe a little bit to some people i,-0.1875,Negative,0
think it's on case by case basis i don't,0.0,Neutral,0
use it much because i just got rid of,0.2,Positive,1
glasses so i don't want to you know um,0.0,Neutral,0
use it too much but i didn't feel any,0.2,Positive,1
eye strain as such because i think the,0.0,Neutral,0
screens are really high quality so um,0.16,Positive,1
it's not too much on your eyes and i use,0.2,Positive,1
lower brightness dark mode i think it's,-0.15,Negative,0
fine uh is it comfortable to wear on the,0.4083333333333333,Positive,1
head is it too heavy,-0.2,Negative,0
um i don't think it's too heavy a little,-0.19375,Negative,0
heavy but it's not like a deal breaker,-0.2,Negative,0
for me because the new band that they,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
give the dual loop band that is um,0.0,Neutral,0
comfortable it gives you support here,0.4,Positive,1
and here so you can actually it it lifts,0.0,Neutral,0
it up so i think it's fine um is it,0.4166666666666667,Positive,1
practical for day-to-day like do i work,0.0,Neutral,0
my with like slack and terminal and and,0.0,Neutral,0
vs code or whatever i do not i prefer,0.0,Neutral,0
the monitors to do to monitors i don't,0.0,Neutral,0
think we're quite there yet um so i i i,0.0,Neutral,0
i just got it like a very expensive toy,-0.65,Negative,0
and,0.0,Neutral,0
um it's uh it's just just a toy for now,0.0,Neutral,0
for me uh just to play around with it,0.0,Neutral,0
have fun um i love technology i love,0.43333333333333335,Positive,1
trying out new things um the question,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
that i got quite a lot is it worth,0.3,Positive,1
"4,000 300 or whatever or 3.5 lakh",0.0,Neutral,0
rupees is it worth that much no it's not,0.25,Positive,1
worth that much it's very expensive um i,-0.17500000000000002,Negative,0
would not recommend buying that right,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
now maybe in the future versions when it,0.0,Neutral,0
becomes a much much more smaller uh much,0.2333333333333333,Positive,1
more advanced uh with the battery inside,0.45,Positive,1
the uh headset and not for you to carry,0.0,Neutral,0
around improved battery life much,0.2,Positive,1
smaller footprint then it might be the,0.0,Neutral,0
right time maybe i don't know 3 years 4,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
years 2 years who knows te technology is,0.0,Neutral,0
moving so fast that was my review of the,0.2,Positive,1
vision pro the case i really like uh,0.2,Positive,1
it's not worth 300 but it's a very,0.02500000000000001,Positive,1
premium case that i got um but yeah,0.0,Neutral,0
that's basically about the the vision,0.0,Neutral,0
pro if you have any questions let me,0.0,Neutral,0
know in the comment section,0.0,Neutral,0
below and yeah i'll see you in the next,0.0,Neutral,0
one uh so that was my review of the,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro and um yeah good good one,0.7,Positive,1
apple yeah see you the next one bye,0.0,Neutral,0
music,0.0,Neutral,0
i've tried hundreds of tech gadgets over,0.0,Neutral,0
the last 20 plus years and i can,0.0,Neutral,0
honestly say there's nothing quite like,0.6,Positive,1
the apple vision pro it's an ambitious,0.25,Positive,1
albeit expensive mixed reality headset,-0.25,Negative,0
that looks to propel us all into a,0.0,Neutral,0
future of spatial computing the eye and,0.0,Neutral,0
hand tracking interface is amazing the,0.6000000000000001,Positive,1
3d videos blow away your local theater,0.0,Neutral,0
and the spatial video will put you in,0.0,Neutral,0
the middle of your memories there's also,0.0,Neutral,0
some great ar apps and games that are,0.8,Positive,1
truly immersive but is this thing worth,0.3,Positive,1
"3,500 there's a lot to go over so let's",0.0,Neutral,0
discuss my overall apple vision pro pros,0.0,Neutral,0
and,0.0,Neutral,0
"cons the entrylevel 3,500 apple vision",0.0,Neutral,0
pro kit comes with the headset itself a,0.0,Neutral,0
polishing cloth the basic light seal,0.2,Positive,1
cushion and a second thicker light seal,0.2,Positive,1
cushion and then optionally you have the,0.0,Neutral,0
zeiss optical inserts which you can use,0.0,Neutral,0
if you wear glasses or readers and they,0.0,Neutral,0
attach magnetically to the design so you,0.0,Neutral,0
can actually hear it snap there are two,0.0,Neutral,0
bands that come included with the vision,0.0,Neutral,0
pro the solo knit band is stretchy and,0.0,Neutral,0
makes it really easy to take the vision,0.43333333333333335,Positive,1
pro on and off and you can quickly,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
tighten and loosen the fit with the,0.4,Positive,1
built-in knob the dual loop band,0.0,Neutral,0
provides more stability i find this one,0.5,Positive,1
better for longer vision pro sessions as,0.5,Positive,1
there's more support for what's a pretty,0.375,Positive,1
weighty headset for people who wear,0.0,Neutral,0
reading glasses like myself the inserts,0.0,Neutral,0
cost 99 and prescription lenses cost,0.0,Neutral,0
149 apple care plus will run you an,0.0,Neutral,0
additional 4.99 which gives you 2 years,0.0,Neutral,0
of unlimited repairs and damage,0.0,Neutral,0
protection that's a lot of money then,0.0,Neutral,0
when you tack on accessories like the,0.0,Neutral,0
199 case you're running up a bigger tab,0.0,Neutral,0
than you might initially plan,0.0,Neutral,0
for so what can you actually do with the,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro for starters it's a,0.0,Neutral,0
multitasking champ thanks to the,0.2,Positive,1
built-in m2 chip that runs the vision os,0.0,Neutral,0
i launched safari in the center of my,-0.1,Negative,0
space then i turn to my left and as siri,0.0,Neutral,0
to launch slack and that app appeared,0.0,Neutral,0
then i turned to the right of safari and,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
open apple music so i could have that,0.0,Neutral,0
playing in the background at any time,0.0,Neutral,0
you can pull up the control center by,-0.1,Negative,0
simply looking up and clicking on the,0.0,Neutral,0
floating downward facing arrow,0.0,Neutral,0
one of the options in control center is,-0.1,Negative,0
the ability to connect with your mac but,0.0,Neutral,0
you can also bring your mac desktop into,0.0,Neutral,0
the vision pro just by looking at it you,0.0,Neutral,0
don't get multiple desktop views but you,0.0,Neutral,0
do get a crystal clear 4k display that,0.10000000000000002,Positive,1
renders text crisply and you can make,0.25,Positive,1
that canvas massive your keyboard and,0.0,Neutral,0
mouse still work as they normally would,0.15,Positive,1
with no latency you can even use your,0.0,Neutral,0
keyboard in vision pro apps if you want,0.0,Neutral,0
yes only apple could do this and i can,0.0,Neutral,0
see myself taking the vision pro on,0.0,Neutral,0
business trips and using it back at the,0.0,Neutral,0
hotel for let's say editing photos or,0.0,Neutral,0
videos or just sitting back and watching,0.0,Neutral,0
a,0.0,Neutral,0
movie starting up front there are two,0.0,Neutral,0
microed displays that give you 23,0.0,Neutral,0
million pixels which is the equivalent,0.0,Neutral,0
of more than 4k per eye and on the right,0.39285714285714285,Positive,1
hand side you have the digital crown,0.0,Neutral,0
which will look familiar for apple watch,0.375,Positive,1
owners and what you can do with this is,0.0,Neutral,0
not only control the volume but also how,0.0,Neutral,0
immersive the environments are so if you,0.0,Neutral,0
go all the way to the right you'll close,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
out the world around you and if you go,0.0,Neutral,0
all the way to the left you'll see a,0.0,Neutral,0
live view of whatever's in front of you,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
on the left hand side there's another,0.0,Neutral,0
button and this one is for capturing,0.0,Neutral,0
content just press this button to,0.0,Neutral,0
capture spatial video and photos and you,0.0,Neutral,0
can also double press this to accepting,0.0,Neutral,0

store the vision pro weighs 1.3 to 1.4,0.0,Neutral,0
lbs depending on the light seal and the,0.4,Positive,1
headband configuration which is heavier,0.0,Neutral,0
than the 11in ipad pro on your head for,0.0,Neutral,0
context the meta quest 3 weighs 1.1 lb,0.0,Neutral,0
and the meta quest pro 1.6 lb so the,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro falls somewhere in between i,0.0,Neutral,0
wore vision pro on and off for several,0.0,Neutral,0
hours and i didn't find it uncomfortable,-0.5,Negative,0
to wear but i did feel like taking,0.0,Neutral,0
periodic brakes because of the heft i,0.0,Neutral,0
also got some light marks on my cheeks,0.4,Positive,1
there's no controllers to deal with with,0.0,Neutral,0
the apple vision pro you just use your,0.0,Neutral,0
eyes to look at the element you want to,0.0,Neutral,0
select and then you tap your thumb and,0.0,Neutral,0
index finger together to,0.0,Neutral,0
click the apple vision pros vision os,0.0,Neutral,0
starts with your real world view as the,0.2,Positive,1
baseline bringing digital content into,0.0,Neutral,0
your environment instead of taking it,0.0,Neutral,0
over the video pass through is very,0.2,Positive,1
lifelike thanks to the r1 chip that's,0.25,Positive,1
fast enough to stream images to the,0.1,Positive,1
vision pro's micro oled displays within,0.0,Neutral,0
12 milliseconds that's eight times,0.0,Neutral,0
faster than you can blink as you stare,0.0,Neutral,0
around the home screen view and move,0.0,Neutral,0
your eyes from icon to icon they light,0.4,Positive,1
up ready to be selected the eye tracking,0.2,Positive,1
is so good it's also used to,0.7,Positive,1
authenticate you via optic id which,0.0,Neutral,0
measures your pupils as a security,0.0,Neutral,0
biometric so think face for your eyes,0.0,Neutral,0
when it works it works well but a couple,0.0,Neutral,0
of times during my testing it didn't,0.0,Neutral,0
work and sometimes you need to re-enter,0.0,Neutral,0
your pin code via a floating keyboard to,0.0,Neutral,0
enable optic,0.0,Neutral,0
id hand gestures for the vision pro let,0.0,Neutral,0
you scroll from left to right and up and,0.14285714285714285,Positive,1
down by pinching your fingers together,-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
and then dragging in the direction that,0.0,Neutral,0
you want zooming in on a photo or web,0.0,Neutral,0
page is as easy as pinching your fingers,0.43333333333333335,Positive,1
together with both hands and then,0.0,Neutral,0
spreading them apart it's very very,0.26,Positive,1
intuitive think of environments on the,0.0,Neutral,0
apple vision pro as 3d desktops on,0.0,Neutral,0
steroids there are several options,0.0,Neutral,0
available ranging from yus and halika to,0.4,Positive,1
the moon i tried mount hood and was,0.0,Neutral,0
floored by the level of realism with,0.0,Neutral,0
detailed sand and rocks beneath my feet,0.4,Positive,1
rippling water in front of me and a,0.0,Neutral,0
towering mountain in the background,0.0,Neutral,0
turning the digital crown clockwise for,0.0,Neutral,0
more or counterclockwise for less i,0.16666666666666669,Positive,1
tuned just how removed from my actual,0.0,Neutral,0
environment i want it to be the apple,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro lets you type on a floating,0.0,Neutral,0
keyboard to enter text but it's not very,-0.1,Negative,0
satisfying for one there's no tactile,0.5,Positive,1
feedback even though you can hear clicks,0.0,Neutral,0
as you type and you can't type very,0.2,Positive,1
quickly it's more of a pe pe pec,0.5,Positive,1
scenario i do like that you can enter,0.0,Neutral,0
text with your voice for example if,0.0,Neutral,0
you're in safari and you just stare at,0.0,Neutral,0
the microphone icon in the address bar,0.0,Neutral,0
and speak toms guy.com it will,0.0,Neutral,0
automatically take you to that website,0.0,Neutral,0
it's kind of magical also keep in mind,0.55,Positive,1
that you can easily pair a bluetooth,0.43333333333333335,Positive,1
keyboard to the apple vision pro for,0.0,Neutral,0
easier and faster text,0.0,Neutral,0
input with the apple vision pro you,0.0,Neutral,0
don't need a home theater like this in,0.0,Neutral,0
order to have an immersive experience in,0.0,Neutral,0
fact with this headset you could take a,0.0,Neutral,0
100t screen wherever you'd go to watch,0.0,Neutral,0
3d movies the apple vision pro on day,0.0,Neutral,0
one is already a first class,0.25,Positive,1
entertainment device and it will make,0.0,Neutral,0
even the biggest skeptic a believer in,0.0,Neutral,0
3d movies there are hundreds of 3d,0.0,Neutral,0
titles available on apple tv plus i was,0.4,Positive,1
personally blown away when i saw the,0.0,Neutral,0
mario brothers movie so not only did i,0.0,Neutral,0
get a 3d vision in front of me in terms,0.0,Neutral,0
of the action but because of the,0.1,Positive,1
environments that you can put up behind,-0.4,Negative,0
it it was like i was floating in the,0.0,Neutral,0
clouds as i was watching the movie i,0.0,Neutral,0
almost felt like i get into the action,0.1,Positive,1
myself so even watching a simple nature,0.0,Neutral,0
video on youtube can become larger than,0.0,Neutral,0
life because you can super siize the,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
player within safari and then place it,0.0,Neutral,0
on a wall in front of you and it's even,0.0,Neutral,0
bigger than the screen that's in this,0.0,Neutral,0
room if you want to take entertainment,0.0,Neutral,0
to the next level there's immersive,0.0,Neutral,0
video i'm not someone who watches a lot,0.0,Neutral,0
of adventure videos but i was blown away,0.0,Neutral,0
when i was able to see a woman walk,0.5,Positive,1
across a tight rpp attached to two,-0.17857142857142858,Negative,0
mountains and if you look down you will,-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
feel a little bit little bit scared cuz,-0.1875,Negative,0
you see the height that she's doing this,0.0,Neutral,0
from and i also got up close in personal,0.0,Neutral,0
with alicia keys in the rehearsal studio,0.0,Neutral,0
and as i looked around i could see the,0.0,Neutral,0
instruments we have our backup singers,0.0,Neutral,0
and musicians on the right hand side so,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
it's almost like you're sort of like,0.0,Neutral,0
eavesdropping on the rehearsal process,0.0,Neutral,0
as i was listening to alicia keys in the,0.0,Neutral,0
immersive video it reminded me of the,0.0,Neutral,0
fact that you don't need to use,0.0,Neutral,0
headphones because you have these audio,0.0,Neutral,0
pods built in to the left and right hand,0.14285714285714285,Positive,1
side and they deliver really great audio,0.8,Positive,1
quality in terms of the clarity but also,0.0,Neutral,0
surprisingly good low-end if you want,0.7,Positive,1
truly the best audio experience you want,1.0,Positive,1
to pair the apple vision pro with a pair,0.0,Neutral,0
of airpods especially the usbc model,0.0,Neutral,0
because that's lossless,0.0,Neutral,0
audio but how about entertainment via,0.0,Neutral,0
your own content i took a special video,0.47857142857142854,Positive,1
of my three dogs at home in our sun room,0.0,Neutral,0
and each pup looked in incredibly,0.9,Positive,1
lifelike as they got closest to the,0.3,Positive,1
camera and it was like i could reach out,0.0,Neutral,0
and pet them you'll get the best results,1.0,Positive,1
if your subjects are moving and you stay,0.0,Neutral,0
fairly still as i lost that immersive,0.7,Positive,1
effect when i turn my head to follow,0.0,Neutral,0
them around but of course wearing this,0.0,Neutral,0
headset in public is going to make you,0.0,Neutral,0
look geeky the good news is that you can,0.7,Positive,1
use your iphone 15 pro or pro max,0.0,Neutral,0
because with the most recent updates you,0.25,Positive,1
can now capture spatial videos directly,0.1,Positive,1
through your iphone the vision pro also,0.0,Neutral,0
brings panoramic photos to life in a new,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
way by wrapping them around you so it's,0.0,Neutral,0
as if you're standing in the center of,-0.1,Negative,0
the frame for example i took an amazing,0.6000000000000001,Positive,1
panorama of the manhattan skyline from,0.0,Neutral,0
the balcony of a bronx apartment and i,0.0,Neutral,0
was completely immersed in the photo,0.1,Positive,1
from the coca-cola truck on the left,0.0,Neutral,0
side of the frame to the bridge in the,0.0,Neutral,0
center and the tall skyscrapers peeking,-0.1,Negative,0
through the cloudy background the apple,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro can run over a million,0.0,Neutral,0
compatible iphone and ipad apps at,0.0,Neutral,0
launch which is nice but i was more,0.55,Positive,1
interested in testing the truly native,0.25,Positive,1
vision pro apps the most impressive,0.75,Positive,1
vision pro app i tried is dj which puts,0.0,Neutral,0
you right in front of a mixer and,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
turntables i had no idea what i was,0.0,Neutral,0
doing but i was still blown away with,0.0,Neutral,0
the realism of the table itself and the,0.0,Neutral,0
fact that i could interact with all the,0.0,Neutral,0
buttons sliders and needles as if they,0.0,Neutral,0
were there i also played what the golf,0.0,Neutral,0
where you can place the virtual course,0.0,Neutral,0
anywhere in the room and start putting,0.0,Neutral,0
it's very noteworthy what apps are not,0.2,Positive,1
here at launch for the vision pro such,0.0,Neutral,0
as netflix and youtube there's not even,0.0,Neutral,0
ipad compatible apps right now when,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
asked about snubbing the vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
netflix's ceo said that they're in,0.0,Neutral,0
discussions with apple but right now the,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
device is so subscale it's not,0.0,Neutral,0
particularly relevant yikes apple,0.4,Positive,1
doesn't want people to be closed off,-0.1,Negative,0
from the rest of the world while using,0.0,Neutral,0
the vision pro so they've developed a,0.1,Positive,1
few technologies to keep you at least,-0.25,Negative,0
somewhat connected the first innovation,0.25,Positive,1
is eyesight eyesight allows others to,0.0,Neutral,0
see a digital version of your eyes when,0.0,Neutral,0
they try to engage you while you're,0.0,Neutral,0
wearing vision pro if someone comes up,0.0,Neutral,0
to talk to you they'll break into your,0.0,Neutral,0
view and they'll see your eyes it's a,0.0,Neutral,0
subtle effect and a bit creepy looking,-0.41666666666666663,Negative,0
but still effective still there's no,0.6,Positive,1
substitute for you know briefly taking,0.0,Neutral,0
off the,0.0,Neutral,0
headset let's talk about digital persona,0.0,Neutral,0
because it is one of the most unique,0.4375,Positive,1
features and honestly creepiest features,0.6,Positive,1
about the apple vision pro but the idea,0.0,Neutral,0
is that when you're in a facetime call,0.0,Neutral,0
or zoom or other apps that support it,-0.125,Negative,0
you can use a digital avatar of yourself,0.0,Neutral,0
in those calls and it'll mimic your,0.0,Neutral,0
expressions your smiles your smirks and,0.0,Neutral,0
even your blanks because of the eye,0.0,Neutral,0
tracking it actually it kind of reminds,0.6,Positive,1
me of nba players in nba 2k where you,0.0,Neutral,0
have that uncanny valley experience,0.0,Neutral,0
where it it looks like that person but,0.0,Neutral,0
once they start talking and moving you,0.0,Neutral,0
know that it's not,0.0,Neutral,0
real beyond all the controls and cool,0.275,Positive,1
features i did encounter some bugs at,0.0,Neutral,0
time with the vision pro for example,0.0,Neutral,0
during one session the headset refused,0.0,Neutral,0
to open the photos app i was staring at,0.0,Neutral,0
and clicking on taking the headset off,0.0,Neutral,0
and putting it back on fixed the problem,0.05,Positive,1
on another occasion siri refused to open,0.0,Neutral,0
some apps like slack and apple music,0.0,Neutral,0
while opening others it wasn't a,0.0,Neutral,0
consistent issue but it was still,0.25,Positive,1
annoying let's talk about the elephant,-0.8,Negative,0
in the room and that is the fact that,0.0,Neutral,0
the apple vision pro needs to be,0.0,Neutral,0
attached to this portable battery at all,0.0,Neutral,0
times that's how it gets power there's,0.0,Neutral,0
no battery in the headset itself it's,0.0,Neutral,0
partially because of how much power this,0.05,Positive,1
thing requires it's 12.4 o which is,0.0,Neutral,0
heavier than the iphone 15 pro max so,0.0,Neutral,0
when you're not using the battery when,0.0,Neutral,0
you're standing up you could just put it,0.0,Neutral,0
in your back pocket like this for,0.0,Neutral,0
example and while the cord is long,-0.05,Negative,0
enough most of the time if you're really,0.2333333333333333,Positive,1
in immersed in a game or other,-0.2625,Negative,0
experience and you move quickly you,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
could accidentally tug the battery off,0.0,Neutral,0
the table or couch onto the floor,0.0,Neutral,0
depending on how you connect everything,0.0,Neutral,0
the wire can get tangled like this and,0.0,Neutral,0
it's already not super long i haven't,-0.10833333333333334,Negative,0
had any issues where it's gotten snagged,0.0,Neutral,0
on something but i've also been very,0.2,Positive,1
conscious of the fact that it's there,0.1,Positive,1
the apple vision pros battery is rated,0.0,Neutral,0
for 2 hours of general use and 2.5 hours,0.05000000000000002,Positive,1
of video playback in my testing on and,0.0,Neutral,0
off over 2 hours the vision pro was down,-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
to about 60% and then down down to 40%,-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
after another couple of hours if you,0.0,Neutral,0
want to use the vision pro continuously,0.0,Neutral,0
you can always just plug in the battery,0.0,Neutral,0
using the included usbc power,0.0,Neutral,0
adapter when i think about the apple,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro there's a few words that come,-0.2,Negative,0
to mind one is unmatched the other is,-0.125,Negative,0
just wow and fully immersive and that's,0.1,Positive,1
because i really do feel like the vision,0.2,Positive,1
pro pushes the boundaries in terms of,0.0,Neutral,0
what we would think of an ar and vr,0.0,Neutral,0
device in one sure it's easy to scoff at,0.4666666666666667,Positive,1
because of its price and i definitely,0.0,Neutral,0
can't afford one at,0.0,Neutral,0
"3,500 but now that i've been wearing",0.0,Neutral,0
this review unit and testing all of its,0.0,Neutral,0
features i would argue that it's the,0.0,Neutral,0
most innovative apple product since the,0.5,Positive,1
original iphone do i think that most,0.4375,Positive,1
people are going to buy one no but i do,0.0,Neutral,0
think that it really sets the stage for,0.2,Positive,1
the next era of computing that said some,0.0,Neutral,0
may want to wait for the rumored lower,0.0,Neutral,0
cost version on the horizon but there's,0.0,Neutral,0
no timetable for that my bottom line in,0.0,Neutral,0
the vision pro that we have right here,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
right now is that it's definitely,0.14285714285714285,Positive,1
revolutionary but it's a revolution in,0.0,Neutral,0
progress for more on the apple vision,0.5,Positive,1

i've been using vr for 7even years but,0.0,Neutral,0
the apple vision pro is the only headset,0.0,Neutral,0
that could get me to use it for six to,0.0,Neutral,0
even 12 hours a day and time goes by so,0.0,Neutral,0
quickly but does that actually mean it,0.010416666666666657,Positive,1
is worth the price well it is very hard,-0.03958333333333336,Negative,0
to find its value at this price except i,0.0,Neutral,0
might have found a few reasons i've been,-0.2,Negative,0
using the headset for over a month now i,0.0,Neutral,0
have finally feel ready to share my full,0.18333333333333335,Positive,1
review and answer these questions from,0.0,Neutral,0
the perspective of a fervent vr user or,0.0,Neutral,0
vr addict i bought the headset myself,0.0,Neutral,0
which has only cost me five kidneys but,0.0,Neutral,0
since then i've been on a non-stop,0.0,Neutral,0
expedition into the unknown territories,-0.1,Negative,0
of apple's first xr headset so i'll be,0.25,Positive,1
sharing the usual techy stuff visual,-0.125,Negative,0
quality overall performance however i'll,0.0,Neutral,0
primarily be focusing on the overall,0.2,Positive,1
experience the stuff that you can do,0.0,Neutral,0
what has surprised me both good and bad,0.03333333333333336,Positive,1
because i think that's the most,0.5,Positive,1
interesting part of a vr headset review,0.5,Positive,1
if you stick around until the end i'll,0.0,Neutral,0
let you know if i'm keeping my,0.0,Neutral,0
headset i don't think any other headset,-0.125,Negative,0
got as much buzz when it launched on,0.2,Positive,1
february 2nd as the apple vision pro the,0.0,Neutral,0
biggest shock it's super expensive at,-0.08333333333333334,Negative,0
"3,500 especially when it looks like it",0.0,Neutral,0
has fewer features than a 500 headset,0.0,Neutral,0
like the meta quest 3 it seems the quest,0.0,Neutral,0
3 can do everything the vision pro does,0.0,Neutral,0
and then some but it's not that simple,0.0,Neutral,0
i'll tell you why soon the vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
design stands out from other vr headsets,-0.125,Negative,0
with its highend look and view it's,0.0,Neutral,0
crafted from materials like glass,0.0,Neutral,0
aluminium and stainless steel giving it,0.2,Positive,1
a premium touch that definitely feel,0.0,Neutral,0
expensive so much so that it makes me,-0.15,Negative,0
way too scared to break the headset as,0.0,Neutral,0
it feels very fragile like it could,0.0,Neutral,0
break if dropped just once i've have,0.0,Neutral,0
seen these pictures and made me,0.0,Neutral,0
extremely careful with it treating it,-0.1,Negative,0
like a delicate little baby also the,-0.24375,Negative,0
external battery which is easily,0.21666666666666667,Positive,1
accidentally dropped because it's easy,0.43333333333333335,Positive,1
to tuck the cable when you move a little,-0.1875,Negative,0
bit my now sports a dent and a scratch,0.0,Neutral,0
which is a real bummer so i wish this,0.2,Positive,1
whole thing was built to off especially,0.1,Positive,1
since it's something you carry around a,0.0,Neutral,0
lot the headset comes with audio straps,0.0,Neutral,0
a light seew a face cushion and two,0.4,Positive,1
different bands a solo knit band and a,0.0,Neutral,0
dual loop band this battery with its,0.0,Neutral,0
power cable a usbc charging cable an,0.0,Neutral,0
adapter a cover for the headset and a,0.0,Neutral,0
polishing cloth the glass front is a,0.0,Neutral,0
real eye catcher making it look stunning,0.35,Positive,1
although it's easy to get smudes on it,0.43333333333333335,Positive,1
and if that happens the mixed reality,0.0,Neutral,0
can become blurry so i have to use the,0.0,Neutral,0
cloth pretty often on top you'll find,0.375,Positive,1
two buttons for quick action the crown,0.21666666666666667,Positive,1
on the right not only lets you switch,0.14285714285714285,Positive,1
between reality and vr but also controls,0.0,Neutral,0
the volume behind the glass front,-0.4,Negative,0
there's a display for a feature called,0.0,Neutral,0
eyesight it shows people around you if,0.0,Neutral,0
you're looking at them or if you're,0.0,Neutral,0
totally absorbed in what you're doing,0.3,Positive,1
i'll dive deeper into this soon the,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro works by itself just like the,0.0,Neutral,0
quest meaning you don't need any other,-0.125,Negative,0
gadgets to use it but the vision pro is,0.0,Neutral,0
more like an ipad that gives you,0.5,Positive,1
superpowers now you can use your eyes,0.0,Neutral,0
and fingers to navigate speak to open,0.0,Neutral,0
apps or type and transform your cozy,-0.19999999999999998,Negative,0
couch into a spot for work or play it,0.0,Neutral,0
really feels like stepping into the,0.2,Positive,1
future uh like a s-i movie think,0.0,Neutral,0
minority report or maybe iron man's,0.0,Neutral,0
jarvis how the tech progresses is,0.0,Neutral,0
mindblowing sure it's not perfect and,0.0,Neutral,0
i'll explain that by showing you what it,0.0,Neutral,0
lets you do but before we move on i've,0.0,Neutral,0
got something exciting from new to unbox,0.21818181818181817,Positive,1

let's crack it,0.0,Neutral,0
open wow this packaging is no yol let's,0.05,Positive,1

the market zero buyers infinite battery,0.0,Neutral,0

newc and me and now let's continue so,0.0,Neutral,0
the vision pro doesn't use traditional,0.0,Neutral,0
controllers instead it has cameras and,0.0,Neutral,0
sensors to track your eyes and hands,0.0,Neutral,0
during setup you calibrate these for,0.0,Neutral,0
accurate tracking it operates on vision,0.4000000000000001,Positive,1
os an apple system where you navigate by,0.0,Neutral,0
looking at what you want to select and,0.0,Neutral,0
then pinching your index and thumb,0.0,Neutral,0
fingers together to click you can also,0.0,Neutral,0
use gestures for scrolling and zooming,0.0,Neutral,0
it tracks even if your hands are,0.0,Neutral,0
comfortably resting on your lab but,0.4,Positive,1
impressively it even tracks gestures,1.0,Positive,1
when you're looking away from your hands,0.0,Neutral,0
a cool feature is occlusion where your,0.35,Positive,1
own hands appear in front of virtual,0.6,Positive,1
screens i love that this way you can use,0.5,Positive,1
screens like a floating ipad by using,0.0,Neutral,0
ipad and iphone gestures like so now the,0.0,Neutral,0
ey and hand tracking is quick and,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
precise making interactions feel almost,0.4,Positive,1
telekinetic like i'm making things,0.0,Neutral,0
happen just with my thoughts which was,0.0,Neutral,0
definitely a wow moment to me but it's,0.1,Positive,1
not flawless sometimes what you're,-0.5,Negative,0
looking at doesn't match what you want,0.0,Neutral,0
to control leading to accidental clicks,0.0,Neutral,0
and sometimes the ey tracking gets off,0.0,Neutral,0
track making it not work right,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
especially if i move the headset around,0.0,Neutral,0
on my head for comfort so i often have,0.0,Neutral,0
to go through the eye setup again which,0.0,Neutral,0
can get a little bit annoying typing,-0.49375,Negative,0
with just your eyes is not too bad but,-0.6999999999999998,Negative,0
it's quite slow and can strain your eyes,-0.30000000000000004,Negative,0
touching the virtual keyboard is even,0.5,Positive,1
slower because you can use your index,0.0,Neutral,0
fingers thankfully siri apple's voice,0.0,Neutral,0
assistant is included and it helps by,0.0,Neutral,0
letting you launch apps and type with,0.0,Neutral,0
voice commands i think this mix of i,0.0,Neutral,0
hand and voice control despite needing,0.0,Neutral,0
improvements is incredible honestly i,0.75,Positive,1
wish all my devices worked like this but,0.0,Neutral,0
the lack of physical controllers does,0.0,Neutral,0
limit certain interactions and it would,0.21428571428571427,Positive,1
have been nice to have that option for,0.6,Positive,1
better typing and clicking hooking up a,0.5,Positive,1
bluetooth keyboard and apple's magic,0.5,Positive,1
trackpad or even a macbook is a great,0.8,Positive,1
option it's a bummer though that regular,0.0,Neutral,0
bluetooth mice do not work with it it's,0.0,Neutral,0
disappointing and kind of weird but the,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
setup that does work works very smoothly,0.52,Positive,1
and it works across devices but i'll get,0.0,Neutral,0
into that after exploring vision proos,0.0,Neutral,0
mode the two main modes are shared space,0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
and full space each mode has its unique,0.3625,Positive,1
uses first up is shared space when you,0.25,Positive,1
wear the headset you will enter this,0.0,Neutral,0
mode immediately seeing the real world,0.2,Positive,1
through its cameras what's awesome here,1.0,Positive,1
is that you can mix real and digital,0.1,Positive,1
objects in your surroundings a cool,0.35,Positive,1
blend known as mixed reality or pass,0.0,Neutral,0
through mode the first thing that will,0.25,Positive,1
show up is this manual with familiar,0.375,Positive,1
apple apps most apps look like floating,0.5,Positive,1
screens but unlike physical screens you,0.0,Neutral,0
can resize and move these anywhere you,0.0,Neutral,0
would like allowing you to create a,0.0,Neutral,0
workspace or entertainment area right,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
around you at any place what's cool is,0.35,Positive,1
that these screens stay perfectly in,1.0,Positive,1
place even if you walk to another room,0.0,Neutral,0
or down several floors it doesn't drift,-0.07777777777777779,Negative,0
which is something that happens on other,-0.125,Negative,0
headsets and i love apple's cool little,0.22083333333333333,Positive,1
details like fake shadows on their,-0.5,Negative,0
screens to make them look even more real,0.35,Positive,1

"super sharp at a 3,660 * 3,200 pixels",0.10416666666666666,Positive,1
per eye with support for common refresh,-0.3,Negative,0
rates making the virtual screens look,0.0,Neutral,0
almost as good as they do on a 4k,0.7,Positive,1
monitor with great colors and contrast,0.8,Positive,1
which is amazing for watching films i,0.6000000000000001,Positive,1
think it surpasses everything i've tried,0.0,Neutral,0
so far you can also stream flat games,0.037500000000000006,Positive,1
from your ps5 or steim to the headset,0.0,Neutral,0
using apps like mirror playay or,0.0,Neutral,0
steamlink although these apps don't,0.0,Neutral,0
usually support 4k streaming so it is,-0.25,Negative,0
lower quality but it's a little,-0.1875,Negative,0
trade-off if you want to play games in a,0.0,Neutral,0
new spot like comfortably in bed or,0.2681818181818182,Positive,1
maybe in your garden besides comfort one,0.0,Neutral,0
downside is the slight glare or shine,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
you see on the lenses in scenes with,0.0,Neutral,0
high contrast making the environment,0.16,Positive,1
brighter can help a bit with this also,0.0,Neutral,0
you can only rotate the screens around,0.0,Neutral,0
you but you can't angle them just how,0.0,Neutral,0
you like which would have been nice for,0.6,Positive,1
watching something while lying s on your,0.0,Neutral,0
side for example that said watching,0.0,Neutral,0
movies in bed with the headset didn't,0.0,Neutral,0
work at first because turning off the,0.25,Positive,1
lights made it lose track of where it,0.0,Neutral,0
was but there's a fix for that by,0.0,Neutral,0
getting an ir eliminator for just 20,0.0,Neutral,0
the headset can now see in the dark i,-0.15,Negative,0
was able to use the vision pro for 2,0.5,Positive,1
hours straight with all the lights off,0.2,Positive,1
by the way this fix should also work for,0.0,Neutral,0
other standalone headsets one benefit of,-0.125,Negative,0
using vr headsets to watch movies is,0.0,Neutral,0
that they have a 3d mode integrate the,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro as well so you can easily,0.43333333333333335,Positive,1
turn on a 3d movie and you'll instantly,0.0,Neutral,0
see 3d effects that make everything pop,0.0,Neutral,0
out beautifully the vision pro does this,0.85,Positive,1
very well i was amazed at its 3d quality,0.2,Positive,1
it's clear bright and way better than,0.43333333333333335,Positive,1
old movie theer 3d and combined with,0.1,Positive,1
this visual clarity it's just stunning,0.25,Positive,1
vision pro mixes 2d and 3d well too a,0.0,Neutral,0
cool demo that showcases this is called,0.35,Positive,1
encounter dinosaurs which starts on a 2d,0.0,Neutral,0
screen and then makes a t-rex seem to,0.0,Neutral,0
jump out into your room feeling,0.0,Neutral,0
incredibly real thanks to the headset's,0.30000000000000004,Positive,1
great 3d effect but it's not just about,0.8,Positive,1
seeing floating screens you can also,0.0,Neutral,0
interact with 3d objects and games that,0.0,Neutral,0
seem to pop out into your space for,0.0,Neutral,0
example inside heart lets you examine a,0.0,Neutral,0
heart from every angle and a cozy luna,-0.19999999999999998,Negative,0
challenges you with spatial puzzles and,0.0,Neutral,0
new apps with interesting use cases seem,0.3181818181818182,Positive,1
to be added regularly wow quest 3 also,0.1,Positive,1
offers mixed reality experiences like,0.05,Positive,1
these the difference is that the vision,0.0,Neutral,0
pro shines literally with a superior,0.7,Positive,1
visual quality the colors are vibrant,0.08333333333333333,Positive,1
and the graphics are crystal clear but,0.10000000000000002,Positive,1
there's one thing i love here and that,0.5,Positive,1
is how it's handles the dynamic shadows,0.0,Neutral,0
and light for instance if you bring up a,0.4,Positive,1
3d object the lighting and shadows,0.0,Neutral,0
adjust to fit your environment making it,0.4,Positive,1
look incredibly lifelike as you can see,0.3,Positive,1
with this tropy this attention to detail,0.0,Neutral,0
makes everything feel more real bringing,0.35,Positive,1
us closer to what feels like true,0.35,Positive,1
augmented reality or ar however we're,0.0,Neutral,0
not quite there yet because of the p,0.0,Neutral,0
through the feature that lets you see,0.0,Neutral,0
the real world through the headsets,0.2,Positive,1
cameras while it is among the best i've,1.0,Positive,1
seen i expected it to be a lot better,0.2,Positive,1
than the quest tree for the price but,0.0,Neutral,0
the improvement is minor however the,-0.05,Negative,0
vision pro and quest tre use different,0.0,Neutral,0
methods each with its own pros and cons,0.6,Positive,1
i appreciate the vision pro low past,-0.125,Negative,0
through latency like i can pass a ball,0.0,Neutral,0
easily but you can tell it's slightly,0.13333333333333336,Positive,1
delayed when moving your hands quickly,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
it's good enough for everyday tasks like,0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
grabbing a drink making coffee or going,0.0,Neutral,0
the image stays clear without warping or,0.10000000000000002,Positive,1
much distortion reading text from my,0.2,Positive,1
phone works incredibly also thanks to,0.55,Positive,1
apple's flicker sensor that stops screen,0.0,Neutral,0
flickering a surprise and a big plus,0.0,Neutral,0
like other headsets the pass through,-0.125,Negative,0
looks its best in bright light but it's,0.7000000000000001,Positive,1
still a bit grainy and gets a lot,0.0,Neutral,0
grainier when it gets darker then the,0.0,Neutral,0
colors and brightness aren't quite right,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
it is darker and less vibrant than life,0.0,Neutral,0
and there is one issue the display's,0.0,Neutral,0
persistence is higher than most headsets,0.375,Positive,1
causing motion blur during head movement,0.0,Neutral,0
it is very sharp when your head is still,-0.1625,Negative,0
but when you're moving things seem fuzzy,0.0,Neutral,0
possibly causing discomfort for some,0.0,Neutral,0
while it doesn't bother me much it makes,0.2,Positive,1
me not want to walk around using the,0.0,Neutral,0
headset too much this suggests the,0.2,Positive,1
vision pro is made for sitting still,0.0,Neutral,0
rather than moving around making it less,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
ideal for active games for example it's,0.38333333333333336,Positive,1
not a deal breaker though the pass,0.0,Neutral,0
through is still sharper than most,0.5,Positive,1
headsets out there outperforming the,0.0,Neutral,0
quest three but given the high price i,0.16,Positive,1
just hoped for even better quality on,0.5,Positive,1
the headset there's a knob called,0.0,Neutral,0
digital crown twisting it fades you into,0.0,Neutral,0
a virtual environment though apple,0.0,Neutral,0
doesn't officially say it's for virtual,0.0,Neutral,0
reality using the crown does just that,0.0,Neutral,0
the headset comes with some cool virtual,0.35,Positive,1
environments right away including sounds,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
that make you feel like you're really,0.2,Positive,1
there and those scenes change from day,0.0,Neutral,0
to night my topic is the halia kaa,0.0,Neutral,0
volcano in hawaii i'm not sure if i'm,-0.25,Negative,0
saying it correctly but it's so,0.0,Neutral,0
beautiful but it's so hard to show how,0.2791666666666667,Positive,1
life like these 3d places are in a flat,-0.025,Negative,0
video you kind of need to see it,0.6,Positive,1
yourself to get how realistic they are,0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
but they are just so wellmade and,0.0,Neutral,0
peaceful that i bet they spent a lot of,0.075,Positive,1
money creating if you prefer not to be,0.0,Neutral,0
completely cut off from the outside and,0.05,Positive,1
like the idea of using vision pro as an,0.0,Neutral,0
ar headset vision pro actually has some,0.0,Neutral,0
special environments that only put a,0.17857142857142858,Positive,1
filter over your real world for example,0.2,Positive,1
there's one that makes it looks like uh,0.0,Neutral,0
sunlight is filling your room this,0.0,Neutral,0
feature is great for me especially,0.4,Positive,1
during the gloomy days in the,0.0,Neutral,0
netherlands because it somehow makes me,0.0,Neutral,0
feel happier the headset has a travel,0.0,Neutral,0
mode you need to switch on when you're,0.0,Neutral,0
in a moving vehicle but it's not perfect,-0.5,Negative,0
it's all right when you're driving,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
straight like on a highway but if the,0.2,Positive,1
car turns or hits a bumpy road the,0.0,Neutral,0
tracking often gets lost and the screens,0.0,Neutral,0
can shake a lot making them hard to use,-0.2916666666666667,Negative,0
however i think it might work better on,0.5,Positive,1
an airplane because you don't really,0.2,Positive,1
feel turns as much though i haven't,0.2,Positive,1
tried it yet in any case the travel mode,0.0,Neutral,0
definitely needs work for work i've,0.0,Neutral,0
started using mac virtual display which,0.0,Neutral,0
lets your headset display a virtual,0.0,Neutral,0
screen from your macbook or imac it's,0.0,Neutral,0
super easy to set up just look at your,0.3833333333333333,Positive,1
macbook while wearing the headset and it,0.0,Neutral,0
will ask you to connect and then it will,0.0,Neutral,0
do it automatically the virtual screen,0.0,Neutral,0
is like having a bigger 4k version of my,0.0,Neutral,0
macbook screen it's bigger and finally,0.0,Neutral,0
has such great readability that i prefer,0.4,Positive,1
it to my actual 14in macbook screen it's,0.0,Neutral,0
a bit of a l s that you can only have,0.0,Neutral,0
one mac virtual screen at a time but,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro has some powerful,0.3,Positive,1
multitasking features like you can open,0.0,Neutral,0
other vision pro apps next to it making,-0.0625,Negative,0
it still feel like you have multiple,0.0,Neutral,0
monitors i still hope that they will let,0.0,Neutral,0
us add more mega virtual screens soon,0.5,Positive,1
though but there is an app called split,0.0,Neutral,0
screen that helps in the meantime then,0.0,Neutral,0
the most shared space isn't called that,0.5,Positive,1
for nothing because the cool part is how,0.35,Positive,1
you can mix different types of app apps,0.0,Neutral,0
you might have your macbook screen up,0.0,Neutral,0
plus vision pro apps like safari and,0.0,Neutral,0
discord and even play a 3d game all,-0.4,Negative,0
while whatsapping with friends and,0.0,Neutral,0
listening to music this is why apple,0.0,Neutral,0
calls it a spatial computing device i,0.0,Neutral,0
was amazed to find out i could use my,0.0,Neutral,0
connected keyboard and trackpad from my,0.0,Neutral,0
macbook with the native vision pro apps,0.0,Neutral,0
without any hassle so it works,0.0,Neutral,0
seamlessly and you can still combine,0.1,Positive,1
this with i and hand tracking so you can,0.0,Neutral,0
look at a screen far away uh that you,0.1,Positive,1
need and then your mouse cursor appears,0.0,Neutral,0
over there straight away it's actually,0.1,Positive,1
quicker than dragging your mouse cursor,0.0,Neutral,0
through a screen and by combining,0.0,Neutral,0
pinching and everything it can be even,0.0,Neutral,0
quicker than using a regular computer in,0.0,Neutral,0
some cases and i love that you can even,0.5,Positive,1
copy and paste between your macbook and,0.0,Neutral,0
the headset instantly this connectivity,0.0,Neutral,0
is very powerful and feels like another,0.39,Positive,1
superpower making this setup quickly,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
become my go-to for working because it,0.0,Neutral,0
can be as efficient as my desktop but,0.0,Neutral,0
more flexible the only reasons i would,0.25,Positive,1
not use it are that my gaming pc is more,0.5,Positive,1
powerful for gaming and editing and that,0.3,Positive,1
the headset messes up my hair and face,0.0,Neutral,0
which isn't great if i have plans later,0.4,Positive,1
yes i'm seriously sad about that while,-0.5,Negative,0
the quest three can technically do,0.0,Neutral,0
similar things it just doesn't match the,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro multitasking ease or display,0.0,Neutral,0
quality quest's software is just way,0.0,Neutral,0
behind compared to vision os so i really,-0.1,Negative,0
hope that they will be able to catch up,0.5,Positive,1
eventually because this is amazing of,0.6000000000000001,Positive,1
course quest has its own advantages in,0.6,Positive,1
vr gaming for example so talking about,0.0,Neutral,0
that the second mode in fishion pro is,0.0,Neutral,0
full space which is basically vr when,0.35,Positive,1
you launch an app that is built for this,0.0,Neutral,0
mode it's like being totally surrounded,0.0,Neutral,0
by the app you know you got a vr app in,0.0,Neutral,0
your hands if you get a warning to stay,0.0,Neutral,0
aware of your surroundings for instance,0.25,Positive,1
space vision lets you explore space and,0.0,Neutral,0
the stars in a very cool way but what's,0.45499999999999996,Positive,1
really cool is seeing your actual hands,0.175,Positive,1
and arms in vr not just 3d models like,0.0,Neutral,0
in other headsets the vision pro even,-0.125,Negative,0
blends the view of your real arms and,0.2,Positive,1
shoulders into vr and this really,0.2,Positive,1
enhances the feeling of being there,0.0,Neutral,0
incredibly but there are minor issues,0.425,Positive,1
like delays and the lighting mismatches,0.0,Neutral,0
that can remind you that this isn't real,0.2,Positive,1
and the disadvantages in full space that,0.35,Positive,1
you can't use multiple apps at once and,0.0,Neutral,0
there aren't many vr apps yet especially,0.25,Positive,1
games you can stream games like vr chat,0.0,Neutral,0
from your computer using aovr and use,0.0,Neutral,0
your hands to move around but hand,0.0,Neutral,0
gestures only work for simple actions,0.0,Neutral,0
and getting the stream to run without,0.0,Neutral,0
lag can be tricky i was able to make it,0.5,Positive,1
work a little bit though it's possible,-0.09375,Negative,0
to set up physical controller using aovr,0.0,Neutral,0
like steam vr controllers or even the,0.0,Neutral,0
nintendo switch joycons but this is,0.0,Neutral,0
complicated and potentially costly so,-0.25,Negative,0
vision pro isn't a great choice for vr,0.8,Positive,1
gaming but i think this shows potential,0.0,Neutral,0
for improvement oh keep you updated so,0.0,Neutral,0
make sure to subscribe and like this,0.5,Positive,1
video while you're at it here a video of,0.0,Neutral,0
milky way as a thank you then we have,0.0,Neutral,0
the social features the persona is a,0.03333333333333333,Positive,1
digital version of you made from a face,0.0,Neutral,0
id scan with the headsets front camera,0.0,Neutral,0
it's not perfect yet especially with,-0.25,Negative,0
hairstyles like long hair but before a,-0.05,Negative,0
beta version it's really impressive it's,1.0,Positive,1
able to generate your micro expressions,0.5,Positive,1
just by capturing your eyes and mouth,0.0,Neutral,0
data which can feel a bit uncanny at,0.0,Neutral,0
times but is still a remarkable tch feed,0.75,Positive,1
i had a fun facetime call with na and,0.3,Positive,1
disco vr where we could share everything,0.0,Neutral,0
we were doing from showing 3d designs to,0.0,Neutral,0
watching each other play ps5 games and,-0.125,Negative,0
even seeing what the other person sees,-0.125,Negative,0
in first person at some point it's felt,0.25,Positive,1
like hanging out in real life there are,0.2,Positive,1
also features for when you're physically,0.0,Neutral,0
with others if you're in vr the headset,0.0,Neutral,0
can detect people either when you're,0.0,Neutral,0
looking at them or when they walk to you,0.0,Neutral,0
they will fade in like little clouds so,-0.1875,Negative,0
you don't bump into them the same,0.0,Neutral,0
happens if you walk out of your virtual,0.0,Neutral,0
environment because this is part of,0.0,Neutral,0
apple safety feature it also works the,0.0,Neutral,0
other way around with eyesight which is,-0.125,Negative,0
another surprising feature here it's a,0.7,Positive,1
display on the front of the headset that,0.0,Neutral,0
can show things like the apple logo or,0.0,Neutral,0
progress bars when updating the software,0.0,Neutral,0
when you're in vr it shows animations to,0.0,Neutral,0
let others know you might not see them,0.0,Neutral,0
if you're in mixed reality so when you,0.0,Neutral,0
can see other people inside the headset,-0.125,Negative,0
it can show your actual eyes on the,0.0,Neutral,0
headset on the front making other people,-0.125,Negative,0
feel less like her just talking to a,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
device this is even personalized to your,0.0,Neutral,0
own eyes if you've captured your person,0.6,Positive,1
cherry said it made her feel like she,0.0,Neutral,0
was seeing my real eyes and she felt,0.2,Positive,1
like i was more present than with other,0.125,Positive,1
headsets which was positively surprising,0.7,Positive,1
it's funny that it can even recognize my,0.25,Positive,1
reflection when taking a selfie or,0.0,Neutral,0
looking at the mirror eyesight also,0.0,Neutral,0
signals when you're taking photos or,0.0,Neutral,0
videos so people know what you're doing,0.0,Neutral,0
it's smart enough to only show up when,0.07142857142857142,Positive,1
needed though it does struggle,0.0,Neutral,0
recognizing people when it gets darker,0.0,Neutral,0
yes the headset is also a camera which,0.0,Neutral,0
takes spatial photos and videos this is,0.0,Neutral,0
footage in 3d so it lets you capture,0.0,Neutral,0
memories in a way that they pop out when,0.0,Neutral,0
you view them back in the headset it's a,0.0,Neutral,0
cool feature that makes for living,0.35,Positive,1
memories more nostalgic however i,0.0,Neutral,0
haven't found myself using it much yet i,0.2,Positive,1
guess because you can't view them on all,0.0,Neutral,0
devices a big downside is that sharing,0.0,Neutral,0
the headset isn't easy because it's set,0.43333333333333335,Positive,1
up just for you you get a specific light,0.2,Positive,1
se size based on a skin made when you,0.0,Neutral,0
buy it which might not fit everyone else,-0.2,Negative,0
comfortably and there are 28 different,0.2,Positive,1
light sho sizes although this number,0.4,Positive,1
hasn't really been confirmed yet but,0.30000000000000004,Positive,1
there's a lot of course you can get a,0.0,Neutral,0
lights that fits better at the apple,0.5,Positive,1
store but the eye and hand tracking are,0.0,Neutral,0
still calibrated to you fortunately,0.4,Positive,1
there is a guas mode that lets someone,0.0,Neutral,0
else calibrate the headsets for,0.0,Neutral,0
themselves but it takes about 5 minutes,0.0,Neutral,0
so it's not as quick as just trying it,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
on you also can not create multiple user,0.0,Neutral,0
profiles with their own settings and,0.6,Positive,1
persona which is so disappointing and i,-0.6,Negative,0
think they really should have because,0.2,Positive,1
it's so hard to explain what a vr,-0.2916666666666667,Negative,0
headset is like without having people,0.0,Neutral,0
try it quest does this so much better,0.5,Positive,1
the headset also uses something called,0.0,Neutral,0
optic id so it scans your eyes to make,0.0,Neutral,0
sure only you can use your profile and,0.25,Positive,1
your persona so nobody else can pretend,0.0,Neutral,0
to be you so yeah overall these social,0.016666666666666666,Positive,1
featur fe make the vision pro more,0.5,Positive,1
social and safe to use around others,0.26666666666666666,Positive,1
though there is still a lot of room for,0.0,Neutral,0
improvement those are some of the most,0.5,Positive,1
common uses there are other ways to use,-0.2125,Negative,0
the vision pro but that's limited to,-0.07142857142857142,Negative,0
what apps are available the app store is,0.4,Positive,1
divided into two categories apple vision,0.0,Neutral,0
apps and ipad apps vision apps might,0.0,Neutral,0
have extra features compared to ipad,0.0,Neutral,0
apps that are mostly shown as 2d screens,0.5,Positive,1
including the games it is nice though,0.6,Positive,1
having over 600 ipad apps available,0.4,Positive,1
already i noticed this because many apps,0.5,Positive,1
i already use like discord trello and,0.0,Neutral,0
even my password manager bit warden work,0.0,Neutral,0
great out of the box i love that i can,0.65,Positive,1
use bit warden as it can scan my eyes to,0.0,Neutral,0
unlock and autofill my passwords which,0.0,Neutral,0
is super handy in vr where typing,0.4666666666666667,Positive,1
passwords is usually a big annoyance,0.0,Neutral,0
however some ipad apps might run into,0.0,Neutral,0
issues buck since they're not,0.0,Neutral,0
specifically designed for the vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
and some really popular apps like,0.6,Positive,1
netflix or youtube are missing although,-0.2,Negative,0
they might be added later but with such,0.0,Neutral,0
a new device i'm pretty sure that you,0.29545454545454547,Positive,1
will bump into a missing app if you're,-0.2,Negative,0
already in the apple ecosystem like if,0.0,Neutral,0
you have a macbook or an imac already,0.0,Neutral,0
then that problem is solved but if not,0.0,Neutral,0
you will be limited so it's really good,0.3142857142857143,Positive,1
to check if the apps you need are,0.0,Neutral,0
available but let's talk about the more,0.45,Positive,1
techy specs that i haven't touched upon,0.0,Neutral,0
yet the feud of view ipd and performance,0.0,Neutral,0
wearing the vision pro is a bit like,0.0,Neutral,0
putting on ski goggles except everything,0.0,Neutral,0
you see is a that's grainier than real,0.2,Positive,1
life and there's a little bit of light,0.10625000000000001,Positive,1
leak that sneaks in at the bottom but,0.0,Neutral,0
it's not a big deal the futter view,0.0,Neutral,0
isn't great you see the ski goggles like,0.8,Positive,1
borders and you can see the the fov is,0.0,Neutral,0
pretty wide horizontally similar to the,0.049999999999999996,Positive,1
quest 2 but it's more more narrow from,0.26666666666666666,Positive,1
top to bottom this doesn't matter much,0.35,Positive,1
when doing any of the 2d content but it,0.0,Neutral,0
might feel a bit closed in for vr apps,-0.1,Negative,0
or when you're moving about in pass,0.0,Neutral,0
through the lenses mostly give you a,0.5,Positive,1
clear shar picture with a white sweet,0.15,Positive,1
spot except near the very edges where,0.15000000000000002,Positive,1
things can get blurry with lots of color,0.0,Neutral,0
fringing this means sometimes you have,0.0,Neutral,0
to turn your whole head to see something,0.2,Positive,1
clearly in a corner of a screen instead,0.10000000000000002,Positive,1
of just glancing over with just your,0.0,Neutral,0
eyeballs which is a clear disadvantage,0.10000000000000002,Positive,1
over a physical monitor this is one of,0.0,Neutral,0
the things that makes me think that,0.0,Neutral,0
we're not entirely there yet to replace,0.0,Neutral,0
an ultra white monitor but a cool thing,0.175,Positive,1
about the vision pro is how it,0.0,Neutral,0
automatically adjusts the lenses to your,0.0,Neutral,0
eyes to keep everything sharp it uses,-0.125,Negative,0
automatic ipd adjustments which isn't,0.0,Neutral,0
new but they take it a step further by,0.06818181818181818,Positive,1
making it possible to move each lens,0.0,Neutral,0
separately ensuring everything lines up,0.0,Neutral,0
for more people the ipd range is 51 to,0.5,Positive,1
75 mm which is wider than most headsets,0.5,Positive,1
as well that is one of the things how,0.0,Neutral,0
apple really nailed the visual quality,0.1,Positive,1
on this headset it also uses the eye,0.0,Neutral,0
tracking to automatically fix and adjust,0.0,Neutral,0
the image as you look around not only,0.0,Neutral,0
does it do real time distortion,0.2,Positive,1
correction but it also makes whatever,0.0,Neutral,0
you're focusing on really clear and,0.10000000000000002,Positive,1
blurs out the rest this smart trick,0.21428571428571427,Positive,1
known as,0.0,Neutral,0
shakes which can cause motion sickness,0.0,Neutral,0
the vision pro keeps everything nicely,0.6,Positive,1
smooth for multitasking it handles up to,0.4,Positive,1
six to eight screens at once depending,0.0,Neutral,0
on what you do pretty well i've had a,0.25,Positive,1
crash when pushing it too far on purpose,0.1,Positive,1
but usually i don't need that many,0.125,Positive,1
screens maybe five at max and that works,0.0,Neutral,0
without any issues the vision pro really,0.2,Positive,1
does some magic here but hey i guess you,0.5,Positive,1
also paid many organs for that the,0.5,Positive,1
battery la lasts as promised about 2,0.0,Neutral,0
hours for general use and up to 2 and,0.05000000000000002,Positive,1
1/2 hours for watching videos since i,0.0,Neutral,0
mostly stay in one spot with the vision,0.5,Positive,1
pro i keep it plugged in for continuous,0.0,Neutral,0
power and i've been using it for 6 to 8,0.0,Neutral,0
hours daily even 12 like mentioned,0.0,Neutral,0
before without any trouble what holds,-0.2,Negative,0
this headset back though is the comfort,0.0,Neutral,0
the headset weighs about 600 g around 21,0.0,Neutral,0
to 22 o making it heavy on the front oh,-0.2,Negative,0
though the whiteness of the solo knit,0.0,Neutral,0
band helps balance it out surprisingly,0.7,Positive,1
well to put it on you just turn the knob,0.0,Neutral,0
on the strap to loosen it and then you,0.0,Neutral,0
slip it over your head and then tighten,0.0,Neutral,0
it up it feels well thought out however,0.0,Neutral,0
for me this only works for 1 hour max to,0.0,Neutral,0
make it more comfortable i tried,0.45,Positive,1
different solutions but i opted for an,0.0,Neutral,0
affordable velo strap simple solution,0.0,Neutral,0
from studio form with this setup doesn't,0.0,Neutral,0
look great but i can wear it for hours,0.8,Positive,1
without any discomfort a disadvantage is,0.0,Neutral,0
is that it does cover the speaker so the,0.0,Neutral,0
audio sounds more muffled using other,0.1875,Positive,1
headphones can solve that and remember,0.0,Neutral,0
comfort is subjective i've talked to,0.0,Neutral,0
people who told me they are perfectly,1.0,Positive,1
fine with the dual loop band the headset,0.4166666666666667,Positive,1
can get warm too but it's not too,0.6,Positive,1
uncomfortable thanks to the air fence,-0.15,Negative,0
that release heat from top it does that,0.5,Positive,1
very well and since you don't move,0.2,Positive,1
around much while wearing it it's,0.2,Positive,1
manageable but it is still warm enough,0.3,Positive,1
to notice so for me mention it i'm not a,0.0,Neutral,0
fan of the battery and cable setup it's,0.0,Neutral,0
annoying to figure out how to,-0.8,Negative,0
comfortably position them every time i,0.4,Positive,1
put on the headset i don't like taking,0.0,Neutral,0
it off just for quick breaks because,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
adjusting it back too comfortable takes,0.2,Positive,1
time plus the cable gets in the way and,0.0,Neutral,0
it's just inconvenient since you need a,-0.6,Negative,0
pocket to hold the battery if you need,0.0,Neutral,0
to do something quick glasses don't,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
really fit inside the headset unless you,0.4,Positive,1
have a small frame but it's a bit risky,-0.25,Negative,0
since you might sc stretch the lenses,0.0,Neutral,0
for those who wear prescription glasses,0.0,Neutral,0
apple offers special lens adapters for,0.2285714285714286,Positive,1
the headsets which sounds like a safer,0.0,Neutral,0
option i don't wear glasses so i haven't,0.0,Neutral,0
needed to try this as for audio i love,0.5,Positive,1
the buil-in speakers because of the high,0.16,Positive,1
quality realistic spacal audio i love,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
how it plays sound from the direction,0.4,Positive,1
where you've placed things so if you put,0.0,Neutral,0
your youtube music screen to your right,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
the music sounds like it's coming from,0.0,Neutral,0
the right side although i would have,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
liked the option to make it surround me,0.6,Positive,1
me at times plus something that,0.0,Neutral,0
surprised me again was that your audio,0.1,Positive,1
changes with your surroundings so if you,0.0,Neutral,0
turn on a virtual environment it sounds,0.0,Neutral,0
different whether you're listening to,0.0,Neutral,0
music or on a call making it,0.0,Neutral,0
surprisingly immersive i'm not an audio,0.7,Positive,1
fou but i think the audio sounds good,0.7,Positive,1
overall it's still not as good as,0.35,Positive,1
topnotch headphones but it often does,0.0,Neutral,0
the job well and this is what the,0.0,Neutral,0
microphone sounds like this is,0.0,Neutral,0
unfiltered and unedited let me know what,0.0,Neutral,0
you think down below in summary the,-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
apple vision pro isn't without its flaws,0.0,Neutral,0
like the motion blur comfort limited vr,-0.07142857142857142,Negative,0
support and you need to be pretty deep,0.125,Positive,1
into using apple devices to get the most,0.5,Positive,1
out of it yet it is the first headset,0.25,Positive,1
that truly makes productivity related,0.0,Neutral,0
task practical with its unmatched visual,0.0,Neutral,0
clarity it truly excels as a portable,0.0,Neutral,0
giant screen with powerful multitasking,0.15,Positive,1
ability which explains why apple focused,0.0,Neutral,0
so much on these features in her,0.2,Positive,1
advertising and calls it a spatial,0.0,Neutral,0
computing device the absolute,0.2,Positive,1
gamechanger is apple software how it,0.3,Positive,1
works so smoothly on the headset and,0.4,Positive,1
having apps you already used all the,0.0,Neutral,0
time easily accessible makes a huge,0.38750000000000007,Positive,1
difference it makes time go by so,0.0,Neutral,0
quickly because you can do so many,0.41666666666666663,Positive,1
things on here plus it helps that the,0.0,Neutral,0
experience is so intuitive making you,0.0,Neutral,0
feel like you have superpowers compared,0.0,Neutral,0
to meta quest apple software feels light,0.4,Positive,1
years ahead however quest could catch up,0.0,Neutral,0
because when it comes to hardware the,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro is not a huge sleep over,-0.20000000000000004,Negative,0
what's already out there especially not,0.0,Neutral,0
for the price i think the vision pro is,0.0,Neutral,0
best for people who really need to use,0.6,Positive,1
lots of apps and screens at the same,0.0,Neutral,0
time just keep in mind that the vision,0.0,Neutral,0
pro won't drastically boost your,0.0,Neutral,0
productivity to justify this high cost,0.16,Positive,1
cost i would not recommend this headset,0.0,Neutral,0
for most people mainly because of the,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
price if price isn't an issue it could,0.0,Neutral,0
be a great fit for those who travel a,0.6000000000000001,Positive,1
lot who are already deeply embedded in,0.0,Neutral,0
the apple ecosystem and needing a multi,0.0,Neutral,0
monitor setup on the go if that's not,0.0,Neutral,0
you waiting for future updates more apps,0.25,Positive,1
and a potential lighter cheaper version,0.0,Neutral,0
might be wise but you know this headset,0.7,Positive,1
could really push the whole industry to,0.2,Positive,1
do better which is already exciting even,0.4,Positive,1
if it's expensive now it might be,-0.5,Negative,0
surprising to you that i've decided to,0.7,Positive,1
keep m mainly because reviewing xr,0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
headsets is my job and this is a big,0.0,Neutral,0
moment for apple and vr plus i'm really,0.2,Positive,1
curious if i'll keep using it months,-0.1,Negative,0
later so i will keep you posted on that,0.0,Neutral,0
so what do you think have you tried the,0.0,Neutral,0
headset or are you waiting for a more,0.5,Positive,1
affordable option or are you skipping,0.0,Neutral,0
apple all together let me know down,-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
below so this review took a lot of time,0.0,Neutral,0
and thought it took me way longer than,0.0,Neutral,0
any other review out there for some,-0.125,Negative,0
reason so i really appreciate your,0.2,Positive,1
patience on this and if you found it,0.0,Neutral,0
helpful the best way to support us is to,1.0,Positive,1
like and subscribe,0.0,Neutral,0
in this video i'm going to give you my,0.0,Neutral,0
review after having used the apple,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro for 30 days i've used it,0.0,Neutral,0
every single day for the past 30 days,-0.1607142857142857,Negative,0
and i've taken notes on what's good and,0.7,Positive,1
what's bad i'm by no means an apple,-0.6999999999999998,Negative,0
fanboy so this review will be truthful,0.5,Positive,1
and honest i'm going to break down this,0.2222222222222222,Positive,1
review by commonly heard cons and my,-0.3,Negative,0
thoughts on it what i like and don't,0.0,Neutral,0
like on the software side of things what,0.0,Neutral,0
i like and don't like on the hardware,0.0,Neutral,0
side of things how i use use it in my,0.0,Neutral,0
daily life and also the big question,0.0,Neutral,0
would i recommend it and am i glad that,0.5,Positive,1
i bought it so with that being said,0.0,Neutral,0
let's jump right in this intro,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
intentionally left blank okay so the,0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
first thing we're going to start with is,0.25,Positive,1
commonly heard cons and my thoughts on,-0.3,Negative,0
those these are things that you've,0.0,Neutral,0
probably seen in every review you've,0.0,Neutral,0
seen there's things that i've heard in,0.0,Neutral,0
every review i've seen and i just want,0.0,Neutral,0
to give you my two cents on those okay,0.5,Positive,1
so number one is comfort so what are my,0.0,Neutral,0
thoughts on the comfort so let me tell,0.0,Neutral,0
you a little bit about my backstory with,-0.1875,Negative,0
it so i bought it and i tried it,0.0,Neutral,0
initially with the solo loop which is,0.0,Neutral,0
the one that comes on by default on it,0.0,Neutral,0
and after 2 days i hated it and then i,-0.9,Negative,0
switched over to the dual loop and then,0.0,Neutral,0
since i've used the dual loop i would,0.0,Neutral,0
say i'm one of the people who say it's,0.0,Neutral,0
comfortable i have no issues wearing it,0.4,Positive,1
i have no issues wearing it for long,-0.05,Negative,0
periods of time i'd say on average i,-0.15,Negative,0
wear it for about 2 hours hours a day or,0.0,Neutral,0
so but i've worn it anywhere from 30,0.0,Neutral,0
minutes a day all the way up to you know,0.0,Neutral,0
5 to 6 hours a day and with the dual,0.0,Neutral,0
loop you know once you put that on and,0.0,Neutral,0
you apply the straps correctly to your,0.0,Neutral,0
head what i love about it is that you,0.5,Positive,1
can just pop it on and off like a hat,0.0,Neutral,0
and it's not like the solo loop where,0.0,Neutral,0
you constantly have to like loosen it,0.0,Neutral,0
all the way take it off and every time,0.0,Neutral,0
it's a new adjustment you know of,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
tightening it and setting it perfectly,1.0,Positive,1
and you know with that one i found that,0.0,Neutral,0
every 10 to 15 minutes you're constantly,0.0,Neutral,0
tweaking and adjusting and you're never,0.0,Neutral,0
you know you spend half your time,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
worrying about adjusting it and it's,0.0,Neutral,0
just pressure on your head and you get,0.0,Neutral,0
those you know ugly marks on your face,-0.7,Negative,0
the imprint of the the vision pro for me,0.0,Neutral,0
the solo loop it was just horrible but i,-1.0,Negative,0
will say this about it some people love,0.5,Positive,1
the solo loop and hate dual loop and one,-0.8,Negative,0
thing i've realized by also just handing,0.0,Neutral,0
it off to people to use in guest mode is,0.0,Neutral,0
that as far as comfort goes,0.1,Positive,1
you have to try it you have to try both,0.0,Neutral,0
loops you have to try them for a period,0.0,Neutral,0
of time it's not a thing where you can,0.0,Neutral,0
just go to the demo at the apple store,0.0,Neutral,0
try it for 30 minutes and say oh i hate,-0.8,Negative,0
that loop or oh it's uncomfortable you,-0.5,Negative,0
have to try the solo loop i'd say for,0.0,Neutral,0
about a day or two see how that feels,0.0,Neutral,0
try the uh dual band see how that feels,0.0,Neutral,0
and then i think after a few days you'll,-0.2,Negative,0
find which one is comfortable for you so,0.4,Positive,1
that's my thoughts on comfort i would,0.0,Neutral,0
say it is comfortable it is comfortable,0.4,Positive,1
for me and i love it and i don't even,0.5,Positive,1
notice it anymore when i put it on but,0.0,Neutral,0
you do have to play with it and you do,0.0,Neutral,0
have to adjust it now i know what you're,0.0,Neutral,0
"thinking for 3,500 bucks or more this",0.5,Positive,1
thing should just be comfortable like no,0.4,Positive,1
weird adjustment period or anything like,-0.5,Negative,0
that which is something i agree with and,0.0,Neutral,0
i'll come back to this topic later in,0.0,Neutral,0
the review so stick with me because i,0.0,Neutral,0
think you'll want to hear that okay and,0.5,Positive,1
so now another con that i've heard in a,0.0,Neutral,0
lot of reviews and that is is the,0.0,Neutral,0
thought that it's lonely in there and,-0.09999999999999998,Negative,0
what i mean by that is that yes when you,-0.3125,Negative,0
put it on it really sucks right now that,-0.007142857142857145,Negative,0
you're having these amazing experiences,0.6000000000000001,Positive,1
you're in this immersive world you're,0.0,Neutral,0
watching this movie on a 100 foot screen,0.0,Neutral,0
you know you're doing all these great,0.8,Positive,1
things and you're experiencing the stuff,0.0,Neutral,0
but to the outside world you're just a,0.0,Neutral,0
weirdo wearing these you know this,0.0,Neutral,0
headset sitting there moving your hands,0.0,Neutral,0
around and doing word stuff like that,0.0,Neutral,0
and you really want to share that with,0.2,Positive,1
those around you so right now i would,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
say that is a big con when it comes to,0.0,Neutral,0
this device is that you're having,0.0,Neutral,0
experiences people are social creatures,0.03333333333333333,Positive,1
and you want to have to share those with,0.0,Neutral,0
other people so i will say that apple,-0.125,Negative,0
definitely needs to find a way to make,0.0,Neutral,0
this device more interactive more social,0.3444444444444445,Positive,1
amongst other people around you you know,-0.125,Negative,0
once people have multiple devices in the,0.0,Neutral,0
house and yes they're expensive again,-0.5,Negative,0
something else i'll get to but once,0.0,Neutral,0
people have multiple devices or even,0.0,Neutral,0
friends across the country or in the,0.0,Neutral,0
same city as you have them they have to,0.0,Neutral,0
find a way to make these things link up,0.0,Neutral,0
and interact as far as i've heard that,0.1,Positive,1
is a reason why people have returned,0.0,Neutral,0
them is that they put them on and,0.0,Neutral,0
they're kind of alone in this immersive,0.6,Positive,1
space and what's the fun in that you,0.3,Positive,1
know and this actually may be you know,0.0,Neutral,0
one of the biggest cons that this device,0.0,Neutral,0
has right now okay and so another,0.39285714285714285,Positive,1
commonly heard con about this device is,-0.3,Negative,0
the battery so there's the talk about,0.0,Neutral,0
the external battery how it's just kind,0.3,Positive,1
of loose and hanging out and you know no,-0.07692307692307693,Negative,0
one knows what to do with it or certain,0.21428571428571427,Positive,1
reviewers don't know what to do with it,0.0,Neutral,0
and then there's also that it apparently,0.05,Positive,1
dies quickly i for one have never had,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
any issues with the battery the fact,0.0,Neutral,0
that it's an external battery i could,0.0,Neutral,0
care less about that i think it's fine,0.125,Positive,1
you literally just slip it in your,0.0,Neutral,0
pocket not a big deal at all i haven't,0.0,Neutral,0
found any issues with that it's not,0.0,Neutral,0
heavy it doesn't get hot you just put it,0.024999999999999994,Positive,1
in your pocket and it's about the size,0.0,Neutral,0
you know it's a little bit thicker than,-0.1875,Negative,0
say a a cell phone and you just put it,0.0,Neutral,0
in your pocket and that's it you forget,0.0,Neutral,0
about it and you use it um and in terms,0.0,Neutral,0
of battery life i also have not had,0.0,Neutral,0
issues with that um it may be one of,0.0,Neutral,0
those weird buggy software things where,-0.5,Negative,0
some people say that if you know they,0.0,Neutral,0
just leave it out and aren't don't have,0.0,Neutral,0
it plugged in they come back and it has,0.0,Neutral,0
50 30 40% battery power i haven't found,0.0,Neutral,0
that either i'll leave it overnight at,0.0,Neutral,0
100% and when i wake up the next morning,0.0,Neutral,0
it's probably at like 94% you know i've,0.0,Neutral,0
used it for two to three hours at a time,0.0,Neutral,0
and i was fine i want you know it lasted,0.4166666666666667,Positive,1
for two to three hours which is really,0.2,Positive,1
the most that i ever really want to use,0.35,Positive,1
it and i think most people should use it,0.5,Positive,1
and just like anything else you know,0.0,Neutral,0
even using my macbook or whatever you,0.0,Neutral,0
know after like an hour and a half or,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
two you kind of want to naturally take a,0.35,Positive,1
break anyway so that's what i think,0.0,Neutral,0
about the battery no big deal whatsoever,0.0,Neutral,0
okay and so now on to the next thing,0.25,Positive,1
which is what i like and don't like,0.0,Neutral,0
about the software aspects of the vision,0.0,Neutral,0
pro so first what do i like about the,0.25,Positive,1
vision pro or in this case honestly love,0.5,Positive,1
about the vision pro and that is the,0.0,Neutral,0
entertainment factor of the vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
this is probably the main way that i'm,0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
using it i feel like you know i've,0.0,Neutral,0
fallen in love with watching movies,0.5,Positive,1
again i used to you know watch movies,0.0,Neutral,0
all the time and but before buying it i,0.0,Neutral,0
can't remember the last time i honestly,0.3,Positive,1
watched a movie all the way through and,0.0,Neutral,0
with this thing i'm now watching movies,0.0,Neutral,0
all the time because of the immersive,0.0,Neutral,0
experience of genuinely feeling like,0.4,Positive,1
you're sitting in a movie theater or an,0.0,Neutral,0
imax theater or in the case of the,0.0,Neutral,0
disney plus app in tattoo in or on top,0.5,Positive,1
of a skyscraper watching a massive,0.0,Neutral,0
screen in front of you and with the,0.0,Neutral,0
audio just being amazing in it or,0.6000000000000001,Positive,1
wearing it with the airpod pros to me,0.0,Neutral,0
people say that there's no killer app to,0.0,Neutral,0
me the killer app is disney plus you,0.0,Neutral,0
know apple tv plus and it's the,0.0,Neutral,0
entertainment watching movies aspect of,0.0,Neutral,0
it to me that's the killer app that's,0.0,Neutral,0
where when i show that to anyone they,0.0,Neutral,0
are absolutely blown away by it it's not,0.2,Positive,1
the cheesy 3d photos or spatial video no,-0.5,Negative,0
it is watching movies experiencing the,0.0,Neutral,0
movie the way it was intended to be,0.0,Neutral,0
experienced in a massive movie theater i,0.4,Positive,1
watched opener on it and i have to say i,0.0,Neutral,0
felt like i was watching it in a massive,0.0,Neutral,0
imax theater and and then when i went,0.0,Neutral,0
back and rewatched some of the scenes on,0.0,Neutral,0
my you know 55 in nice tv sony,0.6,Positive,1
television it was nowhere close to it so,0.0,Neutral,0
you know you put it on no distractions,0.0,Neutral,0
and you watch the movie with amazing,0.6000000000000001,Positive,1
picture quality amazing sound so that is,0.5,Positive,1
a killer app and a something that i,0.0,Neutral,0
absolutely love about it so now on to,0.5,Positive,1
one of the things i don't like about the,0.0,Neutral,0
software right now and that is something,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
you may have heard and that is that the,0.0,Neutral,0
app store is barren it has nothing in,0.0,Neutral,0
there you know i don't know where these,0.0,Neutral,0
"600 1,000 apps are that are native to",0.0,Neutral,0
the vision pro i i can't find them so,0.0,Neutral,0
far i have scrolled through the app,0.1,Positive,1
store and seen a bunch of crappy apps,0.0,Neutral,0
like you know a cat puzzle thing or,0.0,Neutral,0
there's for some reason a lot of clocks,0.0,Neutral,0
in the app store it's just s it reminds,0.0,Neutral,0
me of when when the first iphone came,0.25,Positive,1
out you know just a bunch of weird apps,-0.5,Negative,0
developers obviously just pumped out as,0.0,Neutral,0
quick as they could put 10 on them 20,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
bucks to buy them really stupid prices,-0.7999999999999999,Negative,0
and that's basically what the app store,0.0,Neutral,0
is right now but luckily that is a con,0.30952380952380953,Positive,1
that will be fixed over time as more,0.3,Positive,1
apps come out that's just a matter of,0.0,Neutral,0
being an early adopter waiting for,0.1,Positive,1
better apps to come out so i'm not too,0.5,Positive,1
worried about that one but that is,0.0,Neutral,0
something that right now is not that,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
great about it and so now on to the,0.8,Positive,1
hardware part of it what i like and do,0.0,Neutral,0
not like about it so my number one love,0.5,Positive,1
about the hardware connected to the,0.0,Neutral,0
entertainment aspect of it is the,0.0,Neutral,0
quality of the screen and then the audio,0.0,Neutral,0
experience so before the vision pro i,0.0,Neutral,0
always thought the spatial audio thing,0.0,Neutral,0
in my airpods pro with the music was,0.0,Neutral,0
just kind of cheesy and i could care,0.04999999999999999,Positive,1
less about it but now i know that that,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
was developed most likely probably for,0.19999999999999998,Positive,1
the vision pro and when you pair the,0.0,Neutral,0
audio experience of just these kind of,0.6,Positive,1
headphones kind of like external,0.3,Positive,1
headphones you know built into the,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro with the quality of the,0.0,Neutral,0
screen where they're just like densely,0.0,Neutral,0
you know dense pixels you can't see the,0.0,Neutral,0
pixels it just looks amazing you know in,0.6000000000000001,Positive,1
terms of the hardware the visual,0.0,Neutral,0
experience and the audio experience are,0.0,Neutral,0
just barone amongst the best i've ever,1.0,Positive,1
seen and and it definitely beats out any,0.0,Neutral,0
experience you might have with a,0.0,Neutral,0
television at home even if you have a,0.0,Neutral,0
70in you know 4k,0.0,Neutral,0
oled i mean it just is nowhere close to,-0.3125,Negative,0
being compared to the apple vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
experience now one of the cons of the,0.0,Neutral,0
hardware which we've touched on already,0.0,Neutral,0
and so i won't go too deep into this is,0.0,Neutral,0
the comfort even though i said that it,0.0,Neutral,0
is comfortable for me and right now i,0.34285714285714286,Positive,1
have no issues with the comfort and i,0.0,Neutral,0
can wear it for hours i agree that it,0.0,Neutral,0
for these prices and for the amount of,0.0,Neutral,0
brilliant people at apple designing,0.9,Positive,1
these things it's amazing that they,0.6000000000000001,Positive,1
can't design something that is,0.0,Neutral,0
comfortable and i think for what you pay,0.4,Positive,1
for it and for what you expect out of,0.0,Neutral,0
apple you should not have to spend,0.0,Neutral,0
multiple days fidgeting with the headset,0.0,Neutral,0
and the straps and changing them out and,0.0,Neutral,0
making sure they're perfectly positioned,0.75,Positive,1
on your forehead and nose and you know,0.0,Neutral,0
your cheekbones and that's just,0.0,Neutral,0
ridiculous to me so a huge con that,0.03333333333333338,Positive,1
could be a deal breaker for a lot and,0.0,Neutral,0
it's already becoming a deal breaker is,0.45,Positive,1
the comfort level if you're one of the,0.0,Neutral,0
lucky ones and it's comfortable um which,0.3666666666666667,Positive,1
honestly most for most people it is you,0.5,Positive,1
know you're great but it should not be a,0.8,Positive,1
thing as it is now you know you should,0.0,Neutral,0
be able to buy it put it on and it's not,0.5,Positive,1
even an issue whatsoever okay and so now,0.5,Positive,1
i want to talk about how i use it in my,0.0,Neutral,0
daily life so you can get a good picture,0.35,Positive,1
of you know where i'm coming from with,0.0,Neutral,0
it this so i'm a professional colorist,0.1,Positive,1
you know i've graded over 60 feature,0.0,Neutral,0
length films i've worked on hundreds of,0.0,Neutral,0
projects for different companies like,0.0,Neutral,0
google espn hbo under arour tons of,0.0,Neutral,0
stuff like that so i'm a da vinci,0.0,Neutral,0
resolve user i'm a professional colorist,0.1,Positive,1
so i bought it to kind of get an early,0.35,Positive,1
start on this technology okay if you're,0.5,Positive,1
interested in that whole side of it,0.225,Positive,1
though check out my other channel on,-0.125,Negative,0
color grading and i'm going to put,0.0,Neutral,0
videos about this dealing with film,0.0,Neutral,0
making and color grading on that channel,0.0,Neutral,0
but that was my main purpose i did see,0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
reviews about it you know i didn't go,0.0,Neutral,0
too deep into it like really,0.1,Positive,1
overanalyzing and picking apart the,0.0,Neutral,0
device like i told you i'm not an apple,0.0,Neutral,0
fanboy but i bought it for those reasons,0.0,Neutral,0
and so in my daily life now i've been,0.0,Neutral,0
using it to edit things like this video,0.0,Neutral,0
and other classes that i have that i,-0.125,Negative,0
teach i've been using it to edit with,0.0,Neutral,0
and i've mainly been using it for,0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
entertainment purposes but over the past,-0.25,Negative,0
30 days i find that as i get used to the,0.0,Neutral,0
device and i start incorporating it into,0.0,Neutral,0
my life and get out of that mindset of,0.0,Neutral,0
like buying it which i think a lot of,0.0,Neutral,0
people are doing it treating it like a,0.0,Neutral,0
laptop and just like checking emails and,0.0,Neutral,0
then saying it sucks and returning it,-0.3,Negative,0
you know it takes time to adjust and,0.0,Neutral,0
find ways to incorporate into your life,0.0,Neutral,0
and now i find that i'm using it for you,0.0,Neutral,0
know more general use things like you,0.275,Positive,1
know researching online and browsing,0.0,Neutral,0
through safari and doing emailing and,0.0,Neutral,0
things like that and having multiple,0.0,Neutral,0
windows open and really using it as a,0.1,Positive,1
productivity tool you know which right,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
now i would say it's biggest pro as a,0.0,Neutral,0
productivity tool isn't the windows,0.0,Neutral,0
because yeah in a lot of ways it is you,0.0,Neutral,0
could easily just buy a secondary big,0.04444444444444445,Positive,1
monitor and you'd be in a similar space,0.0,Neutral,0
right now what i i love about it is the,0.39285714285714285,Positive,1
focus aspect of it is that when you put,0.0,Neutral,0
it on and turn on an environment you are,0.0,Neutral,0
locked in you're focused there's no,0.0,Neutral,0
distractions around you which happen all,0.0,Neutral,0
the time especially if you work from,0.0,Neutral,0
home you put it on you're not distracted,0.0,Neutral,0
and i can focus on what i'm doing so i'm,0.0,Neutral,0
finding it very quickly take over the,0.43333333333333335,Positive,1
spot of it's already beat out my ipad,0.0,Neutral,0
pro already starting to kind of take,0.3,Positive,1
over the duties i guess or the or the,0.0,Neutral,0
things that i did with my macbook pro,0.0,Neutral,0
it's not anywhere close to my mac studio,0.0,Neutral,0
that i use for professional film work,0.1,Positive,1
but with the latest 1.1 update in the,0.5,Positive,1
mac virtual display it did make a huge,0.4000000000000001,Positive,1
leap f and me using it in that way so,0.0,Neutral,0
that's my use is mainly editing and,0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
divin resolve entertainment purposes,0.0,Neutral,0
watching movies but it's i find it,0.0,Neutral,0
slowly creeping into other parts of the,-0.21250000000000002,Negative,0
my life so you know now that i'm finding,0.0,Neutral,0
how i use it and using it more as like a,0.5,Positive,1
spatial computing device i'm find that,0.0,Neutral,0
i'm using it more and more for all kinds,0.5,Positive,1
of things all right and now we're,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
getting towards the end of this and the,0.0,Neutral,0
next big question is would i recommend,0.0,Neutral,0
this and am i glad that i bought it so,0.5,Positive,1
first would i recommend it yes i would,0.25,Positive,1
recommend it however i would say do your,0.0,Neutral,0
research and if you're watching this,0.0,Neutral,0
that's obviously what you're probably,0.0,Neutral,0
doing and i would say know what you're,0.0,Neutral,0
getting know that it's not a polished,0.0,Neutral,0
finished device it's not like an iphone,0.0,Neutral,0
where you'll download it and you'll have,0.0,Neutral,0
all these apps and you'll know what to,0.0,Neutral,0
do with it and you know you'll have,0.0,Neutral,0
games and you'll have different apps and,0.0,Neutral,0
you'll have all these cool experiences,0.35,Positive,1
if that's what you're buying it for you,0.0,Neutral,0
know to immediately jump in and it make,0.0,Neutral,0
your life way better in a lot of,0.5,Positive,1
different areas then you'll probably be,0.0,Neutral,0
be disappointed honestly but if you are,-0.07500000000000001,Negative,0
a nerdy person who likes technology and,0.0,Neutral,0
knows what's involved in being an early,0.1,Positive,1
adopter in a beta version and you've,0.0,Neutral,0
done your research and you know that,0.0,Neutral,0
you're going to get a version 1.0,0.0,Neutral,0
borderline beta device uh that does have,0.0,Neutral,0
some great features great,0.8,Positive,1
functionalities but you're also someone,0.0,Neutral,0
who likes to experiment with the,0.0,Neutral,0
technology and use it for different,0.0,Neutral,0
things and um wait for updates to to,0.0,Neutral,0
come out and wait for apps to come out,0.0,Neutral,0
then i think that once you have it once,0.0,Neutral,0
you incorporate it into your life and,0.0,Neutral,0
once you know what the device is i think,0.0,Neutral,0
you'll love it and i do think that the,0.5,Positive,1
potential of this device is something,0.0,Neutral,0
that i mean like everything else apple,-0.3125,Negative,0
this is following the same blueprint the,0.0,Neutral,0
i first iphone did it and you know i,0.25,Positive,1
remember what it was like when the apple,0.0,Neutral,0
watch came out and the macbook all these,0.0,Neutral,0
different devices same story same,0.0,Neutral,0
blueprint it comes out a lot of people,0.0,Neutral,0
hate it a lot of people you know say,-0.8,Negative,0
it's the stupidest device ever and it's,0.0,Neutral,0
g to fail and within a year or two,-0.5,Negative,0
everyone has one and not only do i think,0.0,Neutral,0
this device is similar but i think it's,0.0,Neutral,0
the best device apple has released since,1.0,Positive,1
probably the iphone to be honest with,0.6,Positive,1
you and if they do things the right way,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
this will be you know a computing,0.0,Neutral,0
revolution kind of like the iphone so,0.6,Positive,1
know what you're getting into if you're,0.0,Neutral,0
going to buy it i actually did two demos,0.0,Neutral,0
at the apple store so i would recommend,0.0,Neutral,0
doing two demos maybe if you can squeak,0.0,Neutral,0
in and do a third one at a different,0.0,Neutral,0
store i don't know if they you know,0.0,Neutral,0
withhold demos once you've done a ton of,0.0,Neutral,0
them but i found that on my first demo i,0.25,Positive,1
actually was very un not very impressed,-0.06153846153846152,Negative,0
i was underwhelmed but on the second,0.0,Neutral,0
demo once i processed the first demo and,0.25,Positive,1
i went back and did the second one after,0.0,Neutral,0
the second one i was sold so that's my,0.0,Neutral,0
thoughts try it know what you're getting,0.0,Neutral,0
into and that's my two cents in terms of,0.0,Neutral,0
would i recommend it but i am very glad,0.65,Positive,1
that i bought it i think this will be a,0.0,Neutral,0
really amazing device that everyone's,0.6000000000000001,Positive,1
going to own okay and so now my final,0.3666666666666667,Positive,1
thoughts on the apple vision pro and,0.0,Neutral,0
that is that i personally love mine it's,0.5,Positive,1
getting to the point now like the iphone,0.0,Neutral,0
that i honestly can't imagine my life,0.6,Positive,1
without it because it is filling a lot,0.0,Neutral,0
of gaps and doing what really technology,0.2,Positive,1
should be doing and that is not taking,0.0,Neutral,0
over your life life but making your life,0.0,Neutral,0
easier and making it so that you can do,0.0,Neutral,0
work quickly more efficiently and it's,0.5,Positive,1
just a tool at the end of the day and i,0.0,Neutral,0
am finding that the vision pro is you,0.0,Neutral,0
know making my life better does it need,0.5,Positive,1
work yes it definitely has a lot of room,0.0,Neutral,0
for improvement in terms of the price in,0.0,Neutral,0
terms of the software in terms of the,0.0,Neutral,0
hardware and all those other things that,-0.125,Negative,0
i mentioned and i think it's a great,0.8,Positive,1
device and i think it's got great,0.8,Positive,1
potential i feel like it's definitely a,0.0,Neutral,0
part of my life part of my worklow part,0.0,Neutral,0
of using it every single day so i hope,-0.07142857142857142,Negative,0
this was helpful if you liked it this is,0.6,Positive,1
a new channel more vision pro stuff,0.3181818181818182,Positive,1
coming any questions ask below like,0.0,Neutral,0
subscribe and i'll see y'all later,0.0,Neutral,0
right now i have my vision pro set up,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
with all my different windows music a,0.0,Neutral,0
browser notes uh files up there i'm,0.0,Neutral,0
using one of the environments now but,0.0,Neutral,0
the birds you're hearing aren't actually,0.0,Neutral,0
coming from the environment cuz i'm,0.0,Neutral,0
sitting outside at a park and all of,0.0,Neutral,0
these,0.0,Neutral,0
windows placed outside and i'm actually,0.0,Neutral,0
able to work i'm paired up with my,0.5,Positive,1
keyboard so i can then select something,0.0,Neutral,0
and work on documents right now my,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
phone's a hotpot with the vision pro and,0.0,Neutral,0
the keyboard's connected with bluetooth,0.0,Neutral,0
and i'm just able to treat it like i,0.5,Positive,1
would my ipad pro or laptop i do feel,0.0,Neutral,0
weird being out in public wearing this,-0.25,Negative,0
i'm not going to lie the vision pro is,0.0,Neutral,0
an expensive first generation device,-0.125,Negative,0
that is far from perfect it has quite a,0.55,Positive,1
few limitations at this point and,-0.2,Negative,0
there's not a lot of apps for it i was,0.0,Neutral,0
actually thinking about returning this,0.0,Neutral,0
one i had it all packed up but i,0.0,Neutral,0
couldn't do it i decided that for,0.0,Neutral,0
whatever flaws and limitations this has,0.0,Neutral,0
it is still one of the most impressive,0.75,Positive,1
pieces of tech i've ever used so in this,0.0,Neutral,0
video i'm going to share with you the,0.0,Neutral,0
reasons why i decided to keep the vision,0.0,Neutral,0
pro and at the end i'll share with you,0.0,Neutral,0
the reasons why i was going to return it,0.0,Neutral,0
i do have to be realistic and,0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
acknowledge the fact that i have a,0.0,Neutral,0
youtube channel that i can blame making,0.0,Neutral,0
a purchase of this on and i can make,0.0,Neutral,0
videos like this to justify getting this,0.0,Neutral,0
i know for most people you can't blame,0.5,Positive,1
it on a youtube channel and these,0.0,Neutral,0
reasons i give you may not be enough,0.0,Neutral,0
reason to still get one now the first,0.25,Positive,1
reason i kept the vision pro and,0.0,Neutral,0
probably one of the biggest reasons is,0.0,Neutral,0
for the magic of this device i think if,0.5,Positive,1
you're going to get one of these you,0.0,Neutral,0
have to really appreciate what the tech,0.2,Positive,1
is and what it's opening up this is a,0.0,Neutral,0
game changer and it will eventually be,-0.4,Negative,0
mainstream uh because what it can do,0.0,Neutral,0
maybe not for a few years but it is,-0.2,Negative,0
going to happen the tech and the vision,0.0,Neutral,0
pro is amazing like the eye tracking you,0.6000000000000001,Positive,1
look at something and you pinch it and,0.0,Neutral,0
it works and it works consistently,0.25,Positive,1
pretty much atime i have an issue doing,0.225,Positive,1
something with the vision pro it's,0.0,Neutral,0
usually my fault i'm trying to select,-0.25,Negative,0
something with my hand over here and i,0.0,Neutral,0
can't see it or my hands blocking the,0.0,Neutral,0
pinching it's not the fault of the,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro when it comes and navigating,0.0,Neutral,0
around the vision pro interface,0.0,Neutral,0
definitely takes some getting used to,0.0,Neutral,0
there's a learning curve to it you know,0.0,Neutral,0
a whole new way of navigating look pinch,0.16818181818181818,Positive,1
and our eyes tend to wander around i am,0.0,Neutral,0
blown away by the vision pro and the,0.0,Neutral,0
ability to put windows in your physical,0.0,Neutral,0
world and they look like something you,0.0,Neutral,0
can touch or even better you can leave,0.5,Positive,1
the world you're in and go to one of the,0.0,Neutral,0
environments and which is incredible and,0.9,Positive,1
looks so lifelike the vision pro is,0.3,Positive,1
something you definitely have to,0.0,Neutral,0
experience if you get a chance to try it,0.0,Neutral,0
out go for it there's no video or,0.0,Neutral,0
description of it that's going to do,0.0,Neutral,0
with justice you have to experience it i,0.0,Neutral,0
did make a video sharing my initial,0.0,Neutral,0
impressions of the vision pro i'll put a,0.0,Neutral,0
link to that video in the description,0.0,Neutral,0
and at the end of this video now the,0.0,Neutral,0
freedom that vision os offers you're not,0.1,Positive,1
limited by any monitor or display it's,-0.07142857142857142,Negative,0
things can be anywhere you want around,0.0,Neutral,0
you you're like yeah there's message is,0.0,Neutral,0
over there let me grab my notes window,0.0,Neutral,0
and walk out of the room holding a,0.0,Neutral,0
virtual note i mean think about this,-0.3125,Negative,0
apple's using cameras to look at my,0.0,Neutral,0
hands and to track my eyeballs to put,0.0,Neutral,0
floating windows that look real not only,0.1,Positive,1
that these windows are touch sensitive,0.1,Positive,1
you can select things with touch on a,0.0,Neutral,0
virtual floating window that's magic now,0.5,Positive,1
if you try the vision pro and after you,0.0,Neutral,0
experience it you still just see an,0.0,Neutral,0
expensive heavy headset with not a lot,-0.35,Negative,0
of applications don't buy it it's not,0.0,Neutral,0
for you yet the next reason i decided to,0.0,Neutral,0
keep the vision pro is this device is,0.0,Neutral,0
the future and i didn't want to wait 2,0.0,Neutral,0
years before i could experience it i,0.0,Neutral,0
mean maybe in 2 years apple will release,-0.3125,Negative,0
the vision air but who knows also they,0.0,Neutral,0
may remove features either way that's,0.0,Neutral,0
going to be expensive too but right now,-0.10714285714285715,Negative,0
i want to be a part of this the cost of,0.0,Neutral,0
the vision pro sucks this thing's,-0.3,Negative,0
expensive ensive and i will never try to,-0.5,Negative,0
justify that to you but to experience,0.0,Neutral,0
this tech and be there in the beginning,0.0,Neutral,0
and to start taking advantage of it it's,0.0,Neutral,0
worth the cost to me plus i could blame,0.3,Positive,1
it on the youtube channel like i,0.0,Neutral,0
mentioned earlier now i have to make,0.0,Neutral,0
content to pay for the vision pro so,0.0,Neutral,0
make sure you subscribe there are some,0.5,Positive,1
good vision pro videos that are going to,0.7,Positive,1
be coming out now the next reason i got,0.0,Neutral,0
the vision pro and one of the main,0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
reasons i initially bought it was for,0.0,Neutral,0
the media side of things the pro is,0.0,Neutral,0
amazing for watching movies youtube,0.6000000000000001,Positive,1
videos or any other content on it i'm in,-0.125,Negative,0
my backyard with the youtube video,0.0,Neutral,0
playing in safari i can even take it,0.0,Neutral,0
with me back inside the house the,0.0,Neutral,0
displays on the vision pro are amazing,0.6000000000000001,Positive,1
you don't see any pixels on anything um,0.0,Neutral,0
there's some limitations that come with,0.0,Neutral,0
all vr headsets and we'll talk about,0.0,Neutral,0
that at the end this is asphalt 8 it's,0.0,Neutral,0
an ipad game that i'm playing out in the,-0.4,Negative,0
park which is insane that i can do that,-1.0,Negative,0
on a vision pro and look at the size of,0.0,Neutral,0
the screen i can place it wherever i,0.0,Neutral,0
want oh and crash now the vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
viewing experience is not about it being,0.0,Neutral,0
the highest resolution device with the,0.0,Neutral,0
highest frame rates or it's definitely,0.0,Neutral,0
not a device meant to share viewing with,0.0,Neutral,0
other people what it is is a theater a,-0.125,Negative,0
home theater on your head with a amazing,0.6000000000000001,Positive,1
virtual surround sound you will never,0.4,Positive,1
have a more immersive experience than,0.5,Positive,1
watching on the vision pro the vision,0.0,Neutral,0
pro is great for any content from,0.8,Positive,1
watching one of the 3d movies or imax,0.0,Neutral,0
movies out or just watching a youtube,0.0,Neutral,0
video like this in the corner while you,0.0,Neutral,0
get some work done i love that you can,0.5,Positive,1
make the screens any size you want you,0.0,Neutral,0
can have a video off to the side plane,0.0,Neutral,0
or you could sit back and relax and have,0.0,Neutral,0
it take up the whole screen and it's,0.2,Positive,1
cool seeing that movie just floating,0.35,Positive,1
there in the perfect aspect ratio you,1.0,Positive,1
can watch that movie sitting by the lake,0.0,Neutral,0
in a theater that you could look around,0.0,Neutral,0
and experience or even in the avengers,0.0,Neutral,0
tower what really blew my mind is,0.2,Positive,1
watching 3d content and the 3d and imax,0.0,Neutral,0
content isn't about making things,0.0,Neutral,0
floating off the screen it instead,0.0,Neutral,0
creates a depth and an environment,0.0,Neutral,0
around you where you're able to look,0.5,Positive,1
left and right and see the image,0.14285714285714285,Positive,1
wrapping around you if you check out,0.0,Neutral,0
apple's immersive movies you can,0.0,Neutral,0
experience things like you're in the,0.0,Neutral,0
room and things are life-size for one,0.0,Neutral,0
you could sit in on the alicia keys,0.0,Neutral,0
recording session in a studio and look,0.0,Neutral,0
around anywhere you want in the room,0.0,Neutral,0
it's like you're a fly on the wall in,0.8,Positive,1
the room another one that uh it freaked,0.0,Neutral,0
"me out was watching the lady 3,000 ft in",0.0,Neutral,0
the air go across a high rope between um,0.16,Positive,1
two cliffs and my hand started to sweat,0.0,Neutral,0
it's like you're sitting there on the,0.0,Neutral,0
rope watching her step on it in front of,0.0,Neutral,0
you i' i've never had such a physical,0.0,Neutral,0
experience while watching something this,0.0,Neutral,0
is really going to be amazing when more,0.43333333333333335,Positive,1
content comes out especially sporting,0.0,Neutral,0
events when you can be in the middle of,0.0,Neutral,0
the field and look around you and,0.0,Neutral,0
experience it and over time we're going,0.0,Neutral,0
to have more companies creating these,0.5,Positive,1
kind of headsets and more content to go,0.55,Positive,1
with with the vision pro you really feel,0.2,Positive,1
like you're experiencing these movies,0.0,Neutral,0
and are in them because of the visuals,0.0,Neutral,0
and the sound the sound out of this,0.4,Positive,1
thing is incredible this little speaker,0.35625,Positive,1
right here on each side sends the sound,0.34285714285714286,Positive,1
like right into your ears and it can do,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
a spatial sound that makes it sound like,0.4,Positive,1
things are coming from behind you or,-0.4,Negative,0
around you it's so good that i usually,0.22499999999999998,Positive,1
just wear this and don't pair any,0.0,Neutral,0
airpods or anything to it because these,0.0,Neutral,0
little speakers sound like a set of,0.10625000000000001,Positive,1
airpods they're that good i'm really,0.44999999999999996,Positive,1
blown away how full uh they're able to,0.425,Positive,1
make this sound now if you pair it with,0.4,Positive,1
the set of airpods even better something,0.5,Positive,1
to be aware of if you do use the,0.25,Positive,1
speakers built in other people can hear,-0.125,Negative,0
what's going on so you might be enjoying,0.5,Positive,1
this loud amazing movie and other people,0.19166666666666668,Positive,1
might not be now the next reason i kept,0.0,Neutral,0
the vision pro is for the whole spatial,0.2,Positive,1
computer in experience i would say the,0.0,Neutral,0
best way to describe it is if you're,1.0,Positive,1
someone who uses your ipad to get things,0.0,Neutral,0
done maybe more than just uh you know,0.5,Positive,1
content and checking the occasional,0.0,Neutral,0
email the vision pro could be a good,0.7,Positive,1
option for you there are actually quite,0.0,Neutral,0
a few ipad apps that work with the,-0.2,Negative,0
vision pro there's also native microsoft,0.0,Neutral,0
office apps so if you do use word or,0.0,Neutral,0
excel it's pretty cool to be able to,0.3666666666666667,Positive,1
pair up a keyboard to the vision pro sit,0.0,Neutral,0
back in your favorite chair resize the,0.25,Positive,1
window just the way you want it maybe,0.0,Neutral,0
have some notes in another window have,0.0,Neutral,0
your messages over here little video,-0.1875,Negative,0
playing off to the side with the news it,0.0,Neutral,0
is a cool thing to be able to work in,0.425,Positive,1
that kind of environment and not have,0.6,Positive,1
the constraints of a a monitor where you,0.0,Neutral,0
have to stack windows on top of each,0.5,Positive,1
other or flip in between windows it's,-0.125,Negative,0
it's weird to have your whole,-0.15,Negative,0
environment be a space for you to work,0.0,Neutral,0
within like when you pair an ipad with a,0.0,Neutral,0
magic keyboard pairing a keyboard to the,0.5,Positive,1
vision pro just opens up so many more,0.5,Positive,1
uses for it so i can sit wherever i want,0.0,Neutral,0
with a keyboard and you can see it has,0.0,Neutral,0
the little auto correct and tracks what,-0.1875,Negative,0
i'm typing so with the keyboard and the,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro i can get work done just,0.0,Neutral,0
about anywhere you can also pair up,0.0,Neutral,0
controllers to it and play games on the,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro which is pretty cool to be,0.3,Positive,1
able to have a huge ipad screen and play,0.45000000000000007,Positive,1
some of my ipad games like some of the,0.0,Neutral,0
games you could play on this you play,0.0,Neutral,0
the one that chops up fruit and the,0.0,Neutral,0
fruit's falling all over the room you're,0.0,Neutral,0
in it's making a mess i really enjoy,0.11250000000000002,Positive,1
being able to use the native apps cuz,0.5,Positive,1
that's where the vision pro shines when,0.0,Neutral,0
they're designed to work within an,0.0,Neutral,0
environment with few limitations now the,-0.2,Negative,0
next reason i kept the vision pro which,0.0,Neutral,0
is also one of the reasons i was going,0.0,Neutral,0
to get rid of it is for the external,0.0,Neutral,0
monitor support with the vision pro you,0.0,Neutral,0
can pair your mac to it and use it as an,0.0,Neutral,0
external display that can be resized and,0.0,Neutral,0
moved around as you like you can also,0.0,Neutral,0
run other vision pro apps at the same,-0.0625,Negative,0
time while you're mirroring your display,0.0,Neutral,0
i do like that i can be more comfortable,0.45,Positive,1
while working on my laptop instead of,0.0,Neutral,0
leaning over it i could sit back in a,0.0,Neutral,0
comfortable chair and have the window,0.4,Positive,1
the monitor,0.0,Neutral,0
any size i want i can also roll in one,0.0,Neutral,0
of the environments so i'm just focusing,0.0,Neutral,0
on the work with less distractions,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
around i really like that the vision pro,0.2,Positive,1
can serve as an external monitor um but,0.0,Neutral,0
it was also one of the reasons i was,0.0,Neutral,0
going to return and i say that because,0.0,Neutral,0
that external display support was a big,0.0,Neutral,0
reason i bought it when using the vision,0.0,Neutral,0
pro as an external display it works,0.0,Neutral,0
great with a lot of apps but there's,0.8,Positive,1
other apps that i don't want to use on,-0.125,Negative,0
it especially ones that have a lot of,0.0,Neutral,0
text and the reason why is it's a little,-0.1875,Negative,0
laggy and it's not as sharp as my studio,-0.125,Negative,0
display that virtual display for my mac,0.0,Neutral,0
is also not as sharp as the native apps,-0.125,Negative,0
so i in certain cases i like to use this,0.21428571428571427,Positive,1
as an external display but i really,0.1,Positive,1
don't use it as much as i expected to,-0.1,Negative,0
and for it being one of the main reasons,0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
for buying it whenever i can i try to,0.0,Neutral,0
use the vision pro apps i mean there's,-0.3125,Negative,0
certain things like editing and final,0.10714285714285714,Positive,1
cut pro i don't mind doing that on this,0.0,Neutral,0
but it's not my favorite i'm either,0.5,Positive,1
taking advantage of this thing for all,0.0,Neutral,0
the things it can do natively or i'm,0.0,Neutral,0
kind of moving over to my computer and,0.6,Positive,1
my studio display for things that i need,0.0,Neutral,0
that macbook pro support the next reason,0.0,Neutral,0
i wanted to return the vision pro is for,0.0,Neutral,0
some of the technical issues that you,0.0,Neutral,0
run into on pretty much any uh vr,0.225,Positive,1
headset it's just the nature of these,0.0,Neutral,0
devices for example there is some color,0.0,Neutral,0
shifting and some warping of the image,0.0,Neutral,0
on the edges of the lens this happens on,0.0,Neutral,0
pretty much all headsets because of the,0.225,Positive,1
type of lenses that are needed when you,0.0,Neutral,0
have displays close to your eyes i'm not,0.0,Neutral,0
the best person to give all the,1.0,Positive,1
technical breakdown on this i will put,0.0,Neutral,0
in the description a link to lonus tech,0.0,Neutral,0
tips video on it he covered all all,0.0,Neutral,0
those technical issues in better detail,0.25,Positive,1
another thing i didn't like was the,0.0,Neutral,0
light glare that you get in certain,0.30714285714285716,Positive,1
situations for example you could be,0.0,Neutral,0
using pass through in a room and then,0.0,Neutral,0
there's a bright spot in the room well,0.7000000000000001,Positive,1
what'll end up happening as you'll,0.0,Neutral,0
sometimes see reflections on the inside,0.0,Neutral,0
of the lens uh a lot of people won't,0.0,Neutral,0
notice that but i spent 25 years in the,-0.1,Negative,0
entertainment lighting industry and i,0.0,Neutral,0
spent a lot of years doing lighting for,-0.1,Negative,0
video my eyes are very sensitive to,0.13,Positive,1
changes and lighting and shifting and,0.0,Neutral,0
intensity so uh that could be a little,-0.1875,Negative,0
distracting for me but what i found is a,0.0,Neutral,0
nice workaround is to take advantage of,0.6,Positive,1
the environments for one and why the,0.0,Neutral,0
environments work well is that it helps,0.0,Neutral,0
balance everything you're seeing instead,0.0,Neutral,0
of these little cameras and the,-0.1875,Negative,0
processing having to balance the the,0.0,Neutral,0
brightness of the outside world with the,0.0,Neutral,0
windows and all of that when you turn on,0.0,Neutral,0
the environments they're balanced out,0.0,Neutral,0
nicely with the intensity of the windows,0.6,Positive,1
so um i didn't notice as much glare then,0.2,Positive,1
another thing i had to get over or get,0.0,Neutral,0
used to was the limited field of view uh,-0.07142857142857142,Negative,0
that's something you experience with all,0.0,Neutral,0
vr headsets there is only so much you,0.1,Positive,1
can see to the side it's you know you're,0.0,Neutral,0
wearing a headset when you're looking at,0.0,Neutral,0
things you get i or i do at least you,-0.3,Negative,0
get caught up in the enjoyment of it,0.0,Neutral,0
that you forget about it but it's easy,0.43333333333333335,Positive,1
to oh yeah i'm wearing a headset all the,0.0,Neutral,0
time now another reason i was going to,0.0,Neutral,0
return the vision pro is just the,0.0,Neutral,0
wearing it the fit of it it's a heavy,0.1,Positive,1
device and uh you really have to get the,0.2,Positive,1
right strap the right light seal and all,0.3238095238095238,Positive,1
that so it's comfortable initially mine,0.2,Positive,1
wasn't feeling very comfortable cuz the,0.52,Positive,1
lenses were too close together and were,0.0,Neutral,0
hitting on my nose in an uncomfortable,-0.5,Negative,0
way but once i spread the lenses a,0.0,Neutral,0
little bit it became more comfortable,0.23750000000000002,Positive,1
and when i put the right light seal on,0.34285714285714286,Positive,1
for me it now sits on my face nicely so,0.6,Positive,1
it's not too much pressure on the,0.2,Positive,1
forehead or the cheeks and none on the,0.0,Neutral,0
nose with these different things that i,0.0,Neutral,0
didn't like initially about the device,0.0,Neutral,0
it really had me questioning spending,0.2,Positive,1
"3,500 on it i mean should i spend that",-0.3125,Negative,0
much money on a first generation device,0.225,Positive,1
that i'm not a big fan of the display uh,0.0,Neutral,0
support on it and it doesn't have a lot,0.0,Neutral,0
of apps for it yet um well after using,0.0,Neutral,0
it for longer yes i should spend that,0.0,Neutral,0
money on it because this thing is magic,0.5,Positive,1
no it really it's a very cool experience,0.45499999999999996,Positive,1
and i look forward to uh using it more,0.5,Positive,1
now what are your thoughts on the vision,0.0,Neutral,0
pro is this something you'd like to get,0.0,Neutral,0
do you have one do you have plans on,0.0,Neutral,0
getting one let us know in the comments,0.0,Neutral,0
section now if you made it this far,0.1,Positive,1
please consider subscri subcribing also,0.0,Neutral,0
check out this video over here it i,0.0,Neutral,0
share with you all my reactions to using,0.0,Neutral,0
the vision pro i do say wow too many,0.3,Positive,1
times there my apologies for that um,0.0,Neutral,0
i'll see you over there thanks for,0.2,Positive,1
watching bye,0.0,Neutral,0
music,0.0,Neutral,0
let's do this feel like ready player,0.2,Positive,1
one can you see my eyes you can see my,0.0,Neutral,0
eyes i've been covering ar and vr for,0.0,Neutral,0
over a decade the biggest bet in this,0.0,Neutral,0
space in years has finally arrived,0.0,Neutral,0
apple's vision pro a,0.0,Neutral,0
3500 so-called spatial computer now if,0.0,Neutral,0
you' been ar and vr for years what makes,0.0,Neutral,0
the vision pro different and if you're,0.0,Neutral,0
new to the space what makes it a,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
computer well i've been wearing one for,0.0,Neutral,0
days days and i'm about to tell you so,0.0,Neutral,0
let's find,0.0,Neutral,0
out the apple vision pro is like a,0.0,Neutral,0
totally new product from apple but it's,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
design-wise very similar to something,0.0,Neutral,0
like a meta quest 3 it feels like a vr,0.0,Neutral,0
headset you know the weight of this is,0.0,Neutral,0
heavier than a quest 3 it's 1.3 lb but,0.0,Neutral,0
the quest 3 is 1.1 lb so the difference,0.0,Neutral,0
is not that vast but you can definitely,0.0,Neutral,0
feel it this is aluminum and glass on,0.0,Neutral,0
the front how it goes on your face and,0.0,Neutral,0
and how it attaches with these straps,0.0,Neutral,0
really matters this one strap uh feels,0.2,Positive,1
fine for short sessions but i would,0.20833333333333334,Positive,1
really recommend that other dual loop,0.037500000000000006,Positive,1
strap for even longer sessions but the,0.0,Neutral,0
one thing that this doesn't have is a,0.0,Neutral,0
battery so you also have this 3/4 lb,0.0,Neutral,0
battery that's also here so this is 1.3,0.0,Neutral,0
lbs without a battery so that is heavy,-0.2,Negative,0
um and when you put on your face you're,0.0,Neutral,0
going to feel that but i just want to,0.0,Neutral,0
tell you that i really don't think it's,0.2,Positive,1
that different in in size than what,0.0,Neutral,0
something like a quest 3 is like,0.0,Neutral,0
um it is very soft you just turn this,0.13,Positive,1
knob to tighten it and that's it so it's,0.0,Neutral,0
very easy to put on i've gotten used to,0.5633333333333334,Positive,1
uh having it centered on where my eyes,0.0,Neutral,0
are and it feels comfortable one thing,0.4,Positive,1
about vision pro is that i think it's,0.0,Neutral,0
best for the hand tracking eye tracking,1.0,Positive,1
that you be seated a lot of this is,0.0,Neutral,0
browsy type stuff where you're clicking,0.0,Neutral,0
and dragging and swiping and doing stuff,0.0,Neutral,0
like that the other thing is that this,-0.125,Negative,0
doesn't do any room setup which,0.0,Neutral,0
surprised me um the quest 3 has this set,0.1,Positive,1
up your room boundary and all that the,0.0,Neutral,0
vision pro you just get up and walk,0.0,Neutral,0
around hi i'm just taking a look around,0.0,Neutral,0
the room you guys are here i just put,0.0,Neutral,0
this dinosaur experience over here which,0.0,Neutral,0
is bringing this window where the,0.0,Neutral,0
dinosaur is actually leaning its head,0.0,Neutral,0
from the screen into here and is like,0.0,Neutral,0
sniffing it's sniffing my,0.0,Neutral,0
hand there's a big uh i think it's an,0.0,Neutral,0
allosaurus i saw this demo with apple,0.0,Neutral,0
too where it's like going to step into,0.0,Neutral,0
the room,0.0,Neutral,0
now my hands can,0.0,Neutral,0
be seen overlaid with this experience,0.0,Neutral,0
it's like green screen the the occlusion,-0.2,Negative,0
with that is also wild because that is,0.1,Positive,1
not something that you can do in any,0.0,Neutral,0
other headset that i've tried let's try,-0.125,Negative,0
out meditation i feel like this is,0.0,Neutral,0
actually is something you would do in,0.0,Neutral,0
while lying down in bed okay let's do,0.17222222222222222,Positive,1
five,0.0,Neutral,0
minutes hi this is,0.0,Neutral,0
jessica and i'll be guiding you through,0.0,Neutral,0
this meditation on creativity i just,0.0,Neutral,0
want want to share that there's a,0.0,Neutral,0
pulsing ball of like,0.0,Neutral,0
petals it's very,0.2,Positive,1
peaceful how the headset dims your,0.25,Positive,1
surroundings around you and now wo all,0.0,Neutral,0
these petals are flying everywhere and i,0.0,Neutral,0
feel like i'm floating through a,0.0,Neutral,0
multicolored art,0.0,Neutral,0
gallery exhale release that actually was,0.0,Neutral,0
really good to,0.7,Positive,1
do so those are my very first,0.325,Positive,1
impressions of putting on the vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
but let's go into the details apple,0.0,Neutral,0
calls the vision pro a spatial computer,0.0,Neutral,0
but it is a vr ar headset this is a,0.0,Neutral,0
mixed reality headset and i've looked at,0.0,Neutral,0
products like this before and apple's,0.0,Neutral,0
has its own style so it looks like a vr,0.6,Positive,1
headset but on front it almost looks,0.0,Neutral,0
like a curved iphone uh bonded here of,0.0,Neutral,0
aluminum and glass and the controls on,0.0,Neutral,0
top are kind of like an apple watch you,0.55,Positive,1
got a digital crown and you've got a,0.0,Neutral,0
flat button that also handles apple pay,-0.025,Negative,0
payments when you do a double tab so,0.0,Neutral,0
those should feel pretty familiar except,0.3125,Positive,1
the digital crown dials out and in,0.0,Neutral,0
reality bringing this curtain of vr,0.0,Neutral,0
basically around you or brings in the,0.0,Neutral,0
pass through cameras now the pass,0.0,Neutral,0
through cameras are what makes this,0.0,Neutral,0
mixed reality these are very high,0.10400000000000001,Positive,1
resolution cameras that are on the,0.0,Neutral,0
outside along with lar which is on the,0.0,Neutral,0
iphone uh for depth sensing and there,0.0,Neutral,0
are even cameras on the bottom here that,0.0,Neutral,0
handle face tracking so it can see your,0.0,Neutral,0
lips and your mouth movement as well as,0.0,Neutral,0
your eyes inside here the lenses which,0.0,Neutral,0
move to adjust your ipd or inter,0.0,Neutral,0
pupilary distance also have tracking,0.0,Neutral,0
cameras that are in here uh on the,0.0,Neutral,0
inside that handle ey tracking and they,0.0,Neutral,0
also uh are used for optic id so which,0.0,Neutral,0
is a new type of feature i haven't used,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
other headsets that do this that scan,-0.125,Negative,0
your iris to authenticate things like,0.0,Neutral,0
unlocking or making payments um that's,0.0,Neutral,0
apple's new system on here instead of,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
face id or touch id audio is pumped in,0.0,Neutral,0
through these little speakers on the,-0.1875,Negative,0
sides which you can hear uh from the,0.0,Neutral,0
outside but are mostly directed to your,0.25,Positive,1
ears kind of like the meta quest you,0.6,Positive,1
could also put in airpods and just,0.0,Neutral,0
listen to things personalized as well,0.0,Neutral,0
and block out sound let's talk about,0.4,Positive,1
this battery okay you know this battery,0.5,Positive,1
is a thing you have to use an external,0.0,Neutral,0
battery with the vision pro and it's,0.0,Neutral,0
pretty heavy this is all part of one,0.024999999999999994,Positive,1
construction and it's what makes this,0.0,Neutral,0
headset feel a little more uncomfortable,-0.0625,Negative,0
to walk around in to say the least,-0.3,Negative,0
the whole way you interact with vision,0.2,Positive,1
pro is the newest most interesting thing,0.5,Positive,1
here it's the most different from any,0.25,Positive,1
other vr a headset the whole thing is,0.037500000000000006,Positive,1
hand and eye tracking but apple's kept a,0.0,Neutral,0
lot of the gestures pretty simple if you,0.125,Positive,1
want to select something uh you look at,0.0,Neutral,0
it and you tap it and if you want to uh,0.0,Neutral,0
close a window you look at it where,0.0,Neutral,0
something will you can exit out if you,0.0,Neutral,0
want want to be able to bring up the,0.5,Positive,1
apps again you can click on this button,0.0,Neutral,0
up here or you could use siri but if you,0.0,Neutral,0
want to scroll use your fingers to do,0.0,Neutral,0
the swipe gesture and then if you want,0.0,Neutral,0
to zoom you take your two fingers and i,0.0,Neutral,0
do that i can zoom in on wherever i'm,0.0,Neutral,0
looking which is really cool or if i,0.35,Positive,1
look down at the bottom of the screen,-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
and then i can drag my fingers to make,-0.1,Negative,0
the picture bigger or i could swipe back,0.0,Neutral,0
and forth to different photos or if i,0.0,Neutral,0
want to be able to exit the app i can,0.5,Positive,1
look down in an x and i can tap but,-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
there are some areas where i find the,0.0,Neutral,0
precision to be a little challenging,0.15625,Positive,1
that is because of eye tracking if,0.0,Neutral,0
you're looking at something like a web,0.0,Neutral,0
page where there are all sorts of little,-0.1875,Negative,0
things that you could click on on a,0.0,Neutral,0
website uh maybe you get it a little bit,-0.1875,Negative,0
off and then suddenly you're clicking on,0.0,Neutral,0
something that you didn't mean to click,-0.3125,Negative,0
on maybe you accidentally delete,0.0,Neutral,0
something or you undo something and,0.0,Neutral,0
after a while that started to make me,0.0,Neutral,0
feel a little bit fatigued so i'm,-0.1875,Negative,0
curious to see how that feels over time,-0.1,Negative,0
i'm seeing it it's,0.0,Neutral,0
real oh hey what's up bridget hi he can,0.2,Positive,1
can you see me hi those are your is that,0.0,Neutral,0
yeah,0.0,Neutral,0
look i see you blinking i'm blinking i'm,0.0,Neutral,0
smiling so what does it look like to you,0.0,Neutral,0
because i can't actually capture this,0.0,Neutral,0
this is not what i expected it looks,-0.1,Negative,0
like a like a blur really yeah like like,0.2,Positive,1
like there like i want to clean it off a,0.3666666666666667,Positive,1
little bit smudge my my eyes eyesight is,-0.1875,Negative,0
a wild technology that puts your eyes on,0.1,Positive,1
the outside of the vision pro it's,0.0,Neutral,0
animating the eyes real time from the,0.2,Positive,1
same scan data that was used to create,0.0,Neutral,0
the persona my avatar that i use in,0.0,Neutral,0
facetimes i am uh impressed that it kind,0.8,Positive,1
of is very reactive but it isn't as,0.2,Positive,1
clear as i hope it would be i'm kind of,0.35,Positive,1
like can you see me i kind of want to,0.6,Positive,1
squinch a little bit like hey are you in,-0.1875,Negative,0
there so do you see me blinking like,0.0,Neutral,0
this you know at certain angles i can't,0.21428571428571427,Positive,1
just scott's in there somewhere right,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
just just just can you hear me deep down,-0.07777777777777779,Negative,0
right i'm i'm going to open up a grid of,0.14285714285714285,Positive,1
apps okay what what do you see now it's,0.5,Positive,1
much brighter like this blue haze right,0.1619047619047619,Positive,1
okay did i disappear you oh oh i i see,0.5,Positive,1
your eyes with the haze so i can tell,0.0,Neutral,0
you're still able to see me but you're,0.5,Positive,1
clearly in something if i do this and,0.10000000000000002,Positive,1
bring up my whole oh scott's going away,0.2,Positive,1
by now i'm in joshua tree where am i,0.0,Neutral,0
yeah now i can definitely tell that you,0.0,Neutral,0
are not able to see me you appear when i,-0.25,Negative,0
look at you you begin to sort of like,0.0,Neutral,0
ghost in a little bit oh i'm a ghost,-0.1875,Negative,0
yeah you're ghost you're ghost hello,0.0,Neutral,0
it's just me in your virtual land paying,0.0,Neutral,0
you a visit bridget and now i can dial,0.0,Neutral,0
away joshua,0.0,Neutral,0
tree and now now you're here does it,0.0,Neutral,0
know your hands from my hands if i just,0.0,Neutral,0
kind of come in here here and start,0.6,Positive,1
clicking oh wait something something,0.0,Neutral,0
happened bring your hand up hold on,0.0,Neutral,0
we're going we're going to click yeah it,0.0,Neutral,0
opened it ah messing with you i didn't,0.0,Neutral,0
really think that would,0.2,Positive,1
happen one of the most uncanny parts of,0.5,Positive,1
vision pro is persona this whole idea of,0.2,Positive,1
scanning yourself i already did one here,0.0,Neutral,0
and you can see what it looks like with,0.0,Neutral,0
my virtual glasses and my hands popping,0.0,Neutral,0
up here it's not exactly like me i mean,-0.21875,Negative,0
it's kind of close but um you can see,0.6,Positive,1
some emotions here where i i mean i can,-0.3125,Negative,0
do that with my face i can smile and,0.3,Positive,1
this is all virtual so you know that's,0.0,Neutral,0
not actually me this is the uh this is,0.0,Neutral,0
the this is the scan that apple does,0.0,Neutral,0
okay let's test out facetime i'm going,0.5,Positive,1
to call lexi to lexi i'm going to do,0.0,Neutral,0
facetime facetime video from,0.0,Neutral,0
scott lexi oh my goodness i don't know,0.0,Neutral,0
what to what to make of this this is,0.0,Neutral,0
very,0.2,Positive,1
this is very different this is you you,0.0,Neutral,0
look like scott but like from an,0.0,Neutral,0
alternate universe am i talking to like,0.0,Neutral,0
which version and your,0.0,Neutral,0
glasses my hovering glasses your glasses,0.0,Neutral,0
so do you know what you look like what,0.0,Neutral,0
are you doing do you know what you look,0.0,Neutral,0
like what i do know i do yes l i do know,0.0,Neutral,0
what i look like it looks somewhat like,0.0,Neutral,0
me do i look like a normal facetime call,0.15,Positive,1
yeah you're just popping up in a window,0.0,Neutral,0
right now in a volcanic landscape though,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
so as you as you would um hovering,0.0,Neutral,0
hovering over the volcanic basin here,0.0,Neutral,0
i'm going to share my view ready okay,0.35,Positive,1
i'm,0.0,Neutral,0
ready,0.2,Positive,1
oh this is bizarre so like as we're,0.4,Positive,1
talking and i'm in the volcano with you,0.0,Neutral,0
we're going to also like i'm going to,0.0,Neutral,0
like drag this over here put like apple,-0.1,Negative,0
tv like up here if you want to see me,0.0,Neutral,0
adjusting the room environment yes i'm,0.0,Neutral,0
gonna bring the world back,0.0,Neutral,0
in and it's,0.0,Neutral,0
gonna now here's the rest of the oh hi,0.0,Neutral,0
everybody hello i'm never going to get,0.0,Neutral,0
used to,0.0,Neutral,0
this i can really feel like i'm going to,0.2,Positive,1
have like a odd like oh that's bizarre,0.11666666666666668,Positive,1
don't do that that's,0.0,Neutral,0
scary that's scary the hands okay that,-0.16666666666666666,Negative,0
this is like this is a very weird dream,-0.65,Negative,0
that i'm having right now this is not,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
real it looks really trippy from my end,0.2,Positive,1
too wow well thank you for calling me,0.1,Positive,1
have fun in the metaverse bye of course,0.3,Positive,1
i'll talk to you soon bye that was so,0.0,Neutral,0
music,0.0,Neutral,0
weird so that's a little bit about the,-0.34375,Negative,0
vision pro's design and features and,0.0,Neutral,0
what it feels like but what about what,0.0,Neutral,0
you'd actually do with it in everyday,-0.1,Negative,0
life that's a good question you know,0.7,Positive,1
i've only been using this for a handful,0.0,Neutral,0
of days and i think apple makes it,0.0,Neutral,0
pretty clear first this is a a pretty,0.21250000000000002,Positive,1
fantastic personal home theater headset,0.2,Positive,1
but incredibly expensive i think you'll,-0.5,Negative,0
use it for that possibly definitely if,0.0,Neutral,0
you have one watch a video on cet siri,0.0,Neutral,0
open cnet's youtube,0.0,Neutral,0
channel and i'm actually going to play,0.0,Neutral,0
video of,0.0,Neutral,0
myself this is really weird to know,-0.5,Negative,0
that's when i had longer hair i don't,0.0,Neutral,0
normally lie down and watch videos about,-0.0027777777777777957,Negative,0
myself in uh in bed people might use it,0.0,Neutral,0
for doing work and starting to work on a,0.0,Neutral,0
bit of my review here um i am sitting,0.0,Neutral,0
here uh during my during my,0.0,Neutral,0
video um,0.0,Neutral,0
writing and talking on camera and yeah i,0.0,Neutral,0
can just like take some notes and type,0.0,Neutral,0
absolutely terribly while i talk to you,-1.0,Negative,0
but i could just do this and i'm,0.0,Neutral,0
floating a monitor right here so you,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
could just basically do a whole bunch of,0.2,Positive,1
different things at once and float this,0.0,Neutral,0
one up there do siri open um,0.0,Neutral,0
maps i don't know why i'd want to look,0.0,Neutral,0
at a map right now but maybe i just do,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
want to look at a map you don't have to,0.0,Neutral,0
use siri but actually i find it's an,0.0,Neutral,0
easier way to open up stuff you can also,0.0,Neutral,0
search for things with voice,0.0,Neutral,0
cet and so i've got cet up here and i'm,0.0,Neutral,0
checking out the site and i'm talking,0.0,Neutral,0
here and i'm also looking at you and i'm,0.0,Neutral,0
floating 1 2 3 4 five different uh,0.0,Neutral,0
screens up at once and i think you can,0.0,Neutral,0
just keep opening up more and just make,0.5,Positive,1
it a big,0.0,Neutral,0
multitasking environment that goes all,0.0,Neutral,0
around you so one thing apple's selling,0.0,Neutral,0
this headset for is some sort of a a,0.0,Neutral,0
memory device an experiential memory,0.0,Neutral,0
machine the ability to record 3d uh they,0.0,Neutral,0
call spatial videos or photos doing them,0.0,Neutral,0
on the headset or doing them on an,0.0,Neutral,0
iphone 15 pro and playing them back in,0.0,Neutral,0
this i mean you can play back videos in,-0.15625,Negative,0
a vr headset anywhere uh one thing that,0.0,Neutral,0
apple does is making it easy to access,0.43333333333333335,Positive,1
your own photo library um and just tap,0.6,Positive,1
into it plus panoramic photos feel like,0.0,Neutral,0
you're looking at this window into the,0.0,Neutral,0
world that you visited i i take i've,0.0,Neutral,0
taken panoramic photos so looking at,0.0,Neutral,0
them now i have a few that i forgot that,-0.2,Negative,0
i took and suddenly i'm in this giant,0.0,Neutral,0
wraparound window that feels like i'm at,0.0,Neutral,0
the place like my mom's backyard and,0.0,Neutral,0
that's really cool but there are some,0.35,Positive,1
things that feel especially when you,0.0,Neutral,0
expand them into this hazy,0.0,Neutral,0
background like are actually there you,0.0,Neutral,0
know people are are pretty much,0.225,Positive,1
life-sized so i'm looking at my looking,0.0,Neutral,0
at my my relativ staring at me and i'm,0.0,Neutral,0
looking at,0.0,Neutral,0
um walking around central,0.0,Neutral,0
park,0.0,Neutral,0
and it does feel like a hazy minority,0.0,Neutral,0
report sort of uh holographic,0.0,Neutral,0
recollection so yes it can be a memory,0.0,Neutral,0
machine or it's starting to become one,0.0,Neutral,0
the other thing you can do besides,-0.125,Negative,0
connecting a keyboard and trackpad is,0.0,Neutral,0
you could actually pair your macbook and,0.0,Neutral,0
interconnect it with the vision pro so,0.0,Neutral,0
i'm taking a macbook air and i'm putting,0.0,Neutral,0
effectively a giant monitor floating it,0.0,Neutral,0
right here instead of seeing it on my,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
screen i could look at pages i can do a,0.0,Neutral,0
lot of other things i can look at slack,-0.125,Negative,0
to see when people arrive today uh and,0.0,Neutral,0
checked in i can check all my work tools,0.0,Neutral,0
and then i can also still bring up,0.0,Neutral,0
things like vision pro app so i could,0.0,Neutral,0
say uh siri open,0.0,Neutral,0
photos and then all my photos are popped,0.0,Neutral,0
up over there and you can,0.0,Neutral,0
actually if i copy this and then i go,0.0,Neutral,0
over,0.0,Neutral,0
here to,0.0,Neutral,0
pages and i paste,0.0,Neutral,0
it so i actually pasted the photo that i,0.0,Neutral,0
just had open in the photos app now into,0.0,Neutral,0
um into the thing i was working on so,0.0,Neutral,0
let's talk about games if you're,0.0,Neutral,0
thinking about getting a vision pro for,0.0,Neutral,0
games don't get a vision pro because,0.0,Neutral,0
it's not a gaming device if you're you,0.0,Neutral,0
know the the meta quest has games it is,0.0,Neutral,0
a game console and there are hundreds of,-0.4,Negative,0
games on there that are really great and,0.8,Positive,1
immersive apple's gaming presence right,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
now on this is very slight there are a,-0.21666666666666667,Negative,0
couple of apple arcade games that have,0.0,Neutral,0
various elements of immersiveness and,0.0,Neutral,0
there is the ability to use a controller,0.0,Neutral,0
and throw games onto a big screen which,0.0,Neutral,0
is cool um similar to the way you can,0.175,Positive,1
get display glasses like um x reels,0.0,Neutral,0
glasses to do that too but at this price,0.0,Neutral,0
i don't think you're buying a headset to,0.0,Neutral,0
just play your games on a big screen,0.0,Neutral,0
another big thing compared to the quest,0.0,Neutral,0
3 that's missing on vision pro is,-0.2,Negative,0
fitness now i use the quest 3 all the,0.0,Neutral,0
time to uh get exercise every single day,-0.07142857142857142,Negative,0
with supernatural that is an app that i,0.16666666666666666,Positive,1
found to be fantastic a lot of people,0.4,Positive,1
use it for uh for cardio exercise beat,0.0,Neutral,0
saer very active things now apple has,-0.17333333333333334,Negative,0
not been doing active fitness on the,-0.13333333333333333,Negative,0
vision pro yet maybe it's because of,0.0,Neutral,0
safety concerns maybe it's because um,0.0,Neutral,0
this big battery pack so again you want,0.0,Neutral,0
games and you want fitness you you,0.0,Neutral,0
should go for the meta quest so what are,0.0,Neutral,0
the final thoughts on apple vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
and should you buy,0.0,Neutral,0
"one first of all it's a 3,500 mixed",0.125,Positive,1
reality headset i would not recommend,0.0,Neutral,0
that people i know spend that much money,0.2,Positive,1
for something like this but it's one of,0.0,Neutral,0
the most complex products i've ever had,0.1,Positive,1
to review i have so many different,0.25,Positive,1
feelings about it i mean there's the,-0.3125,Negative,0
element of the price but there are also,0.0,Neutral,0
so many fascinating and stunning,0.5666666666666667,Positive,1
experiences that i've had in this,0.0,Neutral,0
headset a little butterfly things that,-0.1875,Negative,0
have opened my eyes in new directions i,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
mean there are ways that this pushes the,-0.3125,Negative,0
boundaries on the technology the way,0.0,Neutral,0
that the display is fantastic in quality,0.4,Positive,1
i mean the fact that it allows the,-0.3125,Negative,0
ecosystem from apple to flow in very,0.2,Positive,1
easily and get work done the persona and,0.43333333333333335,Positive,1
telepresence questions but then there,0.0,Neutral,0
are also the weird things like this,-0.5,Negative,0
dangling battery and this very delicate,-0.39,Negative,0
build i feel like where i'd want to,0.0,Neutral,0
coddle it and take care of it and the,0.0,Neutral,0
fact that there aren't many apps at,0.5,Positive,1
launch and i'm really curious who,-0.1,Negative,0
develops for this at the same time that,0.0,Neutral,0
pro envision pro should tell tell you,0.0,Neutral,0
something this is for people who either,0.0,Neutral,0
want to pay into the future now and see,0.0,Neutral,0
what it's like or people who might be,0.0,Neutral,0
interested in using this for the,0.25,Positive,1
fidelity for things like maybe viewing,0.0,Neutral,0
3d animation or working on a model or,0.0,Neutral,0
maybe it's for you know medical training,0.0,Neutral,0
or the things that you would have used,0.0,Neutral,0
high-end ar headsets before or the types,0.0,Neutral,0
of business vr headsets this could enter,0.0,Neutral,0
that space at that price the future may,0.0,Neutral,0
be on our face or it may be exploring,0.0,Neutral,0
new types of interactions that will flow,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
into other types of devices including,-0.125,Negative,0
our face hard to tell where the future,-0.14583333333333334,Negative,0
is going but i think it dovetails with,0.0,Neutral,0
ai in a lot of ways and i think it's the,0.0,Neutral,0
type of expanded computing ecosystem,0.0,Neutral,0
that we're going to see from a lot of,0.0,Neutral,0
different people this isn't the last,0.0,Neutral,0
time i'm going to talk about vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
we're going to look at this as it keeps,0.0,Neutral,0
evolving and take a look at a lot more,0.5,Positive,1
apps and experiences and think about it,0.0,Neutral,0
in comparison with the rest of the,0.0,Neutral,0
landscape but if you have any other,-0.125,Negative,0
questions make sure to leave them below,0.5,Positive,1
and make sure to like and subscribe,0.5,Positive,1
thanks for watching,0.2,Positive,1

headset from apple for years i know i,0.0,Neutral,0
got to try it out back in june at wwdc,0.0,Neutral,0
this is actually going to be my third,0.0,Neutral,0
first impressions because at the apple,0.25,Positive,1

to spend the 30 on a polishing cloth,0.0,Neutral,0
well you get one with the vision pro,0.0,Neutral,0
this feel this is actually a different,0.0,Neutral,0
polishing cloth this is a much better,0.5,Positive,1
polishing cloth in my opinion it's much,0.2,Positive,1
more of just a regular microfiber cloth,0.25,Positive,1
does it have any apple branding yes it,0.0,Neutral,0
says vision pro here on it uh not sure,-0.25,Negative,0
if you can see that but okay i like this,0.5,Positive,1
polishing cloth apple please sell this,0.0,Neutral,0
without the vision pro branding or,0.0,Neutral,0
whatever cuz this is so much nicer i,0.2,Positive,1
don't like the stiff polishing cloth,-0.21428571428571427,Negative,0

here let's take that out because i'm,0.0,Neutral,0
probably going to want to use this it's,0.0,Neutral,0
not as cool as the solo band for sure,0.425,Positive,1
but uh it's probably the one that you're,0.0,Neutral,0
going to want to use cuz it's definitely,0.0,Neutral,0
the most comfortable and then in here we,0.45,Positive,1
have the battery pack it's a very heavy,-0.26,Negative,0
battery very solid very dense honestly,0.26666666666666666,Positive,1
another thing apple should just sell a,0.0,Neutral,0
battery pack just like this i don't know,0.0,Neutral,0
why it's so nice uh this little,0.20625,Positive,1
connection piece here is how you uh,0.0,Neutral,0
attach it to the vision pro on the side,0.0,Neutral,0
so we will need that and then in here,0.0,Neutral,0
you have your power adapter uh it's just,0.0,Neutral,0
a how many watts is this 65 no 30 watts,0.5,Positive,1
so just a 30 wt adapter and your usbc,0.0,Neutral,0
cable to plug it into the wall and,0.0,Neutral,0
charge it at the same time so that's,0.0,Neutral,0
cool all that's in the box we don't,0.35,Positive,1
usually get a bunch of power adapters,-0.25,Negative,0
and accessories and things but when,0.0,Neutral,0
"you're spending 3,500 on a first gen",0.25,Positive,1
product you better be getting all of the,0.5,Positive,1
stuff and so i'm really glad that apple,0.5,Positive,1
gave you both bands and you don't have,0.0,Neutral,0
to go out and buy it it doesn't look as,0.0,Neutral,0
good with this i got to be honest with,0.6499999999999999,Positive,1
you does not look as good the other band,0.2875,Positive,1

unfortunate because it is not going to,-0.5,Negative,0
stay on your head for very long yeah i,-0.065,Negative,0
mean this looks so much nicer it's just,-0.056249999999999994,Negative,0

i noticed that during the facetime call,0.0,Neutral,0
portion you couldn't hear the person on,0.0,Neutral,0
the other end um and so instead of,-0.125,Negative,0
having you hear me just talk to myself,0.0,Neutral,0
um i can kind of give you a overview of,0.6,Positive,1
what's going on and basically um as you,0.0,Neutral,0
can see from the visible uh shock when i,0.0,Neutral,0
called my wife who had no idea she was,0.0,Neutral,0
creeped out by the persona i think,0.0,Neutral,0
that's going to be a lot of people's,0.0,Neutral,0
first instinct uh i was kind of creeped,0.425,Positive,1
out with mine i don't look very good,0.9099999999999999,Positive,1
um and that could just be because i,0.0,Neutral,0
don't you know that just could be how it,0.0,Neutral,0
is but uh you know i noticed some other,-0.125,Negative,0
people's looked okay and some didn't,0.5,Positive,1
look kind of like how they were supposed,0.6,Positive,1
to so i feel like it's going to be,0.0,Neutral,0
really funny to see everybody's personas,0.25,Positive,1
um but yeah i had a lot of fun talking,0.3,Positive,1
to kevin on facetime we were just having,0.0,Neutral,0
a blast he was showing me now you,0.0,Neutral,0
couldn't screen record this but i can,0.0,Neutral,0

what i'm looking at and that includes,0.0,Neutral,0
like using the camera and showing them,0.0,Neutral,0
around so i was just walking around my,0.0,Neutral,0
studio space here and he he was walking,0.0,Neutral,0
around the house and it's just cool like,0.35,Positive,1
we had a lot of fun the spatial audio,0.3,Positive,1
was crazy i can move uh the person over,-0.6,Negative,0
here like behind me and it sounds like,-0.4,Negative,0
they're talking about it's it's,0.0,Neutral,0
incredible and that's just not even,0.9,Positive,1
using uh airpods that's using the,0.0,Neutral,0
built-in sound from the from the vision,0.4,Positive,1
pro which is amazing so i had a lot of,0.6000000000000001,Positive,1
fun facetiming and yeah the personas are,0.3,Positive,1
a little creepy but it was fun i don't,-0.12916666666666668,Negative,0
know so just wanted to give you that,0.0,Neutral,0
update so that you weren't bored,-0.5,Negative,0
listening to me talk to myself so okay,0.5,Positive,1
uh compatible apps we have all of these,0.0,Neutral,0
apple apps,0.0,Neutral,0
um where are the apps that i just,0.0,Neutral,0
downloaded so carrot let's see dj let's,0.0,Neutral,0
try it real,0.2,Positive,1
quick perfect,0.6666666666666666,Positive,1
chromo this is the first music i've,0.25,Positive,1

work but it works inside of the dj,0.0,Neutral,0
app you strong that's 100,0.4333333333333333,Positive,1
proof,0.0,Neutral,0
music,0.0,Neutral,0

all messed up i'm sure um yeah i mean,0.09375,Positive,1
this is what happens you got to take,0.0,Neutral,0
some breaks i'm going to take a break,0.0,Neutral,0
but in the meantime let's unbox the last,0.0,Neutral,0
of this so this case is absolutely,0.2,Positive,1
massive look at this thing it's really,0.1,Positive,1
nice it's kind of unique i've never,0.525,Positive,1
really seen apple make anything like,0.2,Positive,1
quite like this in terms of an accessory,0.0,Neutral,0
like a smaller version of this for the,0.0,Neutral,0
uh airpods max would have been amazing,0.6000000000000001,Positive,1
like a much smaller version but uh this,0.0,Neutral,0
is what the k should have been not and,0.0,Neutral,0
maybe we still will get there but man,0.0,Neutral,0
this is massive now it's funny because,0.125,Positive,1
we wanted something you know bigger for,0.0,Neutral,0
the airpods max that engulfed the entire,0.0,Neutral,0
headphones but then for this we want,0.0,Neutral,0
something something smaller so we can,0.0,Neutral,0
actually fit it in our backpack but,0.4,Positive,1
let's uh let's get it opened up here you,0.0,Neutral,0
do get vision pro branding right here,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1

strap here and you can even feed the,0.0,Neutral,0
cable,0.0,Neutral,0
through u but yeah everything's going to,0.0,Neutral,0
fit in here so you go ahead you put the,0.4,Positive,1

can feed the battery in,0.0,Neutral,0
here and kind of toss the cables in,0.6,Positive,1

taking it to and from the studio cu i,0.0,Neutral,0
can throw it in my car not so much this,0.2,Positive,1
is not going to be something i can throw,0.0,Neutral,0
in my bag for the plane if it ends up,0.0,Neutral,0
becoming my my computer replacement,0.45,Positive,1
which it's not going to be but my ipad,0.0,Neutral,0
replacement i guess we can find um some,0.0,Neutral,0
room for it but i'm going to have to,0.0,Neutral,0
find another way to travel with this if,0.0,Neutral,0
i'm carrying camera gear and uh i guess,0.0,Neutral,0
i won't need my ipad but i'll need my,0.0,Neutral,0
macbook still so uh we'll have to figure,0.0,Neutral,0
that out i'm excited to try it um that's,0.375,Positive,1
for sure uh we're going to quickly open,0.25,Positive,1
this this video has been super,0.3333333333333333,Positive,1
long in here it's the same as what we,-0.025,Negative,0

to shut it down for a minute and put the,-0.15555555555555559,Negative,0
new battery in or you can plug yourself,0.13636363636363635,Positive,1
in if you really want probably not going,0.2,Positive,1
to wear this right now but if you wanted,0.2857142857142857,Positive,1
to walk around and not put this in your,0.0,Neutral,0
pocket but wear it as like a holster or,0.0,Neutral,0
like a satchel you can do that the,0.0,Neutral,0

engineering that went into this is,0.0,Neutral,0
definitely up there um and the price,0.0,Neutral,0
obviously reflects that oh this kind of,0.3,Positive,1
